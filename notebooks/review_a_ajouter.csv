"We where a late check in and Juliana was so accommodating. I spoke to her a few hours earlier to ask if someone can set up the sofa bed on the room since we where running late and going straight to bed. She did that for us, which I really appreciate. Thanks. The breakfast was delicious and the two attendances where so sweet. I don't remember their names, but I just want to say thanks. The lady that speaks noticed my puertorrican accent and told me that she hopes that everything is good with my family back in the island. From the bottom of my heart thank you for been so sweet with me.During check out, Joy, was so understandable with me and my group.

"This was our 1st stay at the Wisconsin Dells Best Western. We have some handicap, mobility issues, so requested a handicap room. We were pleasantly surprised with the family sized room with plenty of space, lots of beds, and A plus comfort. We were concerned that this motel was a distance from the Dells attractions, but realized we were near... More",1,0,0
"unhappyr We camped there last year. This year we considered going back but the river has flooded the area and our campsite is still muddy and it is July 18th. The owner still wants the full summers rate for camping which, by the way, she raised the prices this year. The owner is constantly sitting at her picnic table and scowls at the campers. She doesn't smile. When she told us that the rates couldn't be discounted we told her that we wouldn't be camping there this year. She said fo...view morer us to get our stuff out of there in one week or she would call the authorites. She said we couldn't camp there ever again. Her son is wonderful and helps his mom run the campground but he has to listen to his controlling mother. She also charges 2 dollars a head for visitors. She's all about the almightly dollar. She called us unfaithful. She even doesn't like our 2 little daschunds. They need to be tied up. Save yourself some money and heartache. DON'T STAY HERE!r r rview less",0,0,0
"Neat landscaping, clean older room. Management appears to care about this place. My son is a student at Toccoa Falls college. This is the best hotel we have found in the area. Ours was a pleasant stay.",0,0,0
"Overall very pleased with hotel. Though there technically was plenty of space, the porta-crib barely fit between the beds. Room was very clean. Liked having the fridge. Bathroom clean. Wifi worked well. Good selection of tv channels, though we didn't watch it too often. Maid did go in one day while we were out despite the do not disturb sign being on door, which makes me uncomfortable, but it was all good. Breakfast was nice in having many choices. Area wasn't first choice, but we weren't going to pay those prices. Convenient to most everything we wanted to do.",0,0,0
"For the location and price this place is a diamond in the rough. It was clean, had all the amenites one would like. But do not expect any service from the staff. The hispancis who cleaned up were the most friendly, they did speak each morning. There was a buffet breakfast that was offered (for a price), we were not even told about it. My daughter found it while exploring the hotel. They run two shuttles to the metro station, neither one would detour out of their way to drop us off at Arlington National Cememtary for a funeral. As I said before the property is well keep, clean, nice and for the location and price a deal. But do not expect southern hosptality or anyone to go out of their way to do anything special for you.",0,0,0
"If you are visiting with kids under 10 years old you will want to be here. Waterslide, pools, beach toys, towels. Mario and Jordan in the pool area will take care of you. Very nice time. Well kept grounds. Saw a guy actually using a floor scrubber to clean the sidewalks. Cinnamon rolls at the store are close to Hall... More",0,0,1
Located right beside Asheville Outlet Mall. A big plus for my wife and daughter. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Always smiled and greeted us when we entered. This will be our first choice for a hotel for all our future visits to Asheville. Five to ten minutes from downtown.,0,0,0
