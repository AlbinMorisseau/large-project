Server during the dinner was also very attentive, friendly and made a nice recommendations of cocktails and food which we are indeed enjoyed. We really enjoyed during our stay. The hotel is definitely Pet Friendly. Thanks a lot for providing all necessary amenities for our dog. We will definitely come back.\n",
      "Negative: The only disappointment was the Wellness, Spa area. There is no separate wellness for hotel guests nor access. We were sharing wellness area with walk in customers. One of sauna was out of order. In order to enter sauna we supposed to walk through the gym which is not really part of hotel rather complete separate gym sharing the same Sauna and wellness area. We felt a bit weird to walk all the way through gym then changing room and finally found the spa&#47; sauna. However sauna was really nice even through not super professional. The water in Cold pool was not really clean, the greenish organic thingy was visible at the bottom of the pool.\n",

I was aware that we had arrived slightly earlier than expected to and said to the staff it is completely understandable if the room isn’t ready but the room was and they were so kind to show me and my partner up there. We booked for tea at 7pm and got seated immediately. Within 45 minutes we had been given our starter and main which were above and beyond what we expected. We couldn’t not leave a tip it was so lovely! Only problem is my stomach was not big enough to fit all the food in. The room was deluxe for a pet friendly room. My dog was comfortable and so were me and my partner! Would absolutely stay again and recommend to anyone around the area! Thank You to the team!\n",

      "Positive: Nestled in the quaint charm of Castronuño, this rural guest house is a delightful haven. The comfort and full amenities provided make it a home away from home, ensuring an enjoyable stay. The spacious outdoor area at the rear is a sunny paradise, perfect for relaxation. Maria, the lovely owner, adds a personal touch with her warmth and helpful nature. For those of you that don’t fancy cooking or eating out, give Maria enough notice and she will happily provide home cooked meals using the finest bio ingredients. Many of which are home grown on their own farm. I can highly recommend the Carrot Cake  With the Douro river just a stone&#39;s throw away, the stunning walks further enhance the experience. A truly charming pet friendly retreat in the heart of Spain&#39;s beauty.  Paul &amp; Ella (the French bulldog)\n",

      "Positive: Nice room, great shower, everything was clean. The receptionist was really great and friendly. The lure is a restaurant right there, and a nice long trail you can take. The place is totally pet friendly, unlike in other places in Spain, your pet can stay in the room with you, but also walk around and go in to have breakfast as well. The receptionist told us that Pamplona is the only town in Spain that adopted a very pet friendly policy from January 1st that allows dogs to go in restaurants with their owners.\n",

We will come back here for sure when if we will come to Slovenia in the future.\n",

There was a dishwasher but we couldnt find detergent for it.  Like I said, this things are some minor aspects. It didn’t bother us that much.\n",

I expected to pay a pet fee when booking, but since I was reached out and told there would be no charge and then have it taken back when checking in was a small damper.\n",

Everything you need was in there, even my pets had a dog bowl for water and food.  The site is very pet friendly, they have a bar onsite and the food is great.  They are so dog friendly a man came straight over with a bowl of water and to give our little doggies a stroke. The lady who sorts everything out called Julie is fantastic, she is so lovely and nothing is too much trouble. She really goes the extra mile with everything.  There was a lovely dog walk around the site. My wife and i will definitely be back this year, and my brother and his wife said they will get one next to us as they liked the look of it so much. I fished on two of the days and it was great because my wife could bring me a cup of tea as i was literally in front of our little house. Just brilliant\n",

      "Positive: We booked the hotel via Booking.com as we find it comes with the pet friendly tick. Overall the place is easy to find. Room is reasonable clean and quiet at night.  We were told on the spot, that the family room cannot have pet, and no other room available. We could not find such information during booking. Then we were disappointed and requested for cancellation. After a while the staff still let us keep the room as it is only for one night, while there will be $60 additional charge for our puppy, which I did not find out during booking.  Overall the staff is friendly and help us change another room as the room’s aircon had water leaking.\n",

      "Positive: We liked EVERYTHING about this cabin! This was our first time staying at a cabin rental and we really didn&#39;t know what to expect, but the property owners really set the bar high! The cleanliness and extra amenities were greatly appreciated. My wife is OCD when it comes to cleanliness and even she was impressed, that says A LOT! This is the PERFECT cabin for a couple or family of 4. We also loved that it was pet friendly so we could bring our little French Bulldog, Bruno. He enjoyed the cabin as well. Very cozy and I loved the wood and decor throughout. The kids loved the complimentary mints and the pool table, mom &amp; dad enjoyed the hot tub! The bed was very soft and comfortable, unlike the stiff beds you would normally get at a hotel. I also appreciated that there were more than 2 pillows, as I am a person who enjoys sleeping with multiple pillows. You really felt at home here. Kitchenware is also provided along with cleaning supplies and some other cooking&#47;bath essentials. We really couldn&#39;t have asked for more! The location was perfect also! literally 2 minutes from the entertainment&#47;shopping&#47;restaurants on the main strip in Pigeon Forge and only about a 15 minute drive to Gatlinburg. Right off the main road yet tucked back far enough to enjoy the peaceful sounds and scenes of nature. I particularly enjoyed sitting on the rocking chairs on the porch every morning in peace while listening the birds chirp and take in the morning fresh air. It was very relaxing. The only thing we didn&#39;t get to enjoy was the firepit because we were too exhausted by the time we came home from the site seeing every night.  I would also like to note the excellent communication with the property owners. They were very quick to respond to messages and answer any questions we had before and during our stay. You can tell they take a lot of pride in their cabin!\n",
      "Negative: There really wasn&#39;t much we didn&#39;t like about this cabin, honestly. A couple of minor suggestions we would make would be to add a Roku box to the bedroom TV, My wife suggests having a liquid hand soap dispenser for the bathroom, although we just went to Publix and got a small one to last us the week. As far as the cabin itself, A++++\n",

Mini fridge and microwave were under a counter cabinet for a clean look and Lee space to spread out.

      "Positive: The property was where we needed to be and we had our 2 little dogs with us, so we needed a pet friendly place.  We were worried because of some of the other reviews we read, but we found it to be just fine.  There was no carpeting, which is good and it didn&#39;t smell bad.  We had room 215, which has windows out the back, so guests making noise on the balcony was not an issue. The bed was not sumptuous but was comfortable enough. It had a good sized refrigerator, the water pressure was fine and the room was spacious.  It is a one-star property and the price reflects that. There are several food choices and coffee places nearby.\n",

I would also repaint in better colors, get new shelves in the refrigerator (there were none), a mattress topper or new mattress, pictures on the wall (bolted on), a new blanket for the bed, coffee maker, and have the cleaning crew do bit of a better job.  There was an opened package of cheese in the refrigerator and dust in the corners, but the main area, bathroom, and bedding were fresh and clean.  I would have been happy to pay a little more for a nicer experience.\n",

The fact that the hotel is pet friendly is great, but given the additional cost the main issue is the extremely strict pet guidelines you are made to sign on arrival, including not being able to leave the dog in the room alone.  As a solo traveller, this made an already tricky arrival&#47;departure even harder as there was no offer of assistance with bags and they have to be fetched from a car parking space deep in a carpark where two elevators need to be taken to reach it.    I think there is a lot of potential with this hotel, but for the price I payed I would not stay again until either the pet policy is relaxed or better assistance is provided with arrival&#47;departure. (For non-pet owners I would raise my rating to a 9 - which is what I would up my rating to if the above mitigations were in place.)\n",

I understand it appeared the hotel was in the middle of restoration. But that does not allow for the disrepair and uncleanness of the grounds and facility! If you are &quot;pet friendly&quot; there should be a specified area for pets to relieve themselves. ALTHOUGH patrons should be responsible for cleaning up after their own pets, UNFORTNATELY, not ALL pet parents do. There should be an area equipped with poop bags and trash can. (I bring my own, but others do not) Hotel staff should police the hotel grounds to keep the area clean. The Hotel was not equipped with an iron. The blow dryer in the bathroom did not work and there was a phone on the night stand BUT it was not connected and was inoperable! THE PICTURES OF THE HOTEL DON&#39;T MATCH THE REAL LIFE!\n",

Then we had to call about the car parking, which we discovered you could park anywhere as there were no designated parking spaces. The lady on the phone was lovely, but I was expecting to see someone face to face. Then we had a problem with our payment because they take the payment anytime after your stay.  So you have to make sure you always have enough money in your account to cover the cost. It seemed so strange. I prefer to pay when we arrive, then you don’t have to worry about it.\n",

Had to pay an extra $100 because &#39;conveniently&#39; our pet room on the 3rd floor was not ready so that was $250 for a pet fee instead of an already high $150 fee. We drove all the way from Texas and tried to check in a early and instead of $50 early check in fee, we got another $100 added to our pet non-refundable fee and had to go to another floor or wait a couple of hours in the car until the room was ready. Who wants to do that after a long drive, especially with a pet? Not really buying that there was no rooms on the 3rd floor ready nor was I happy with the extra $100 pet fee for a total of $250 also charging $10 a day for parking in the open lot (or $15 in the parking garage) is not what I&#39;m looking for when staying somewhere. Parking should be included. It is not like there were any activities going on to charge the fee to guests nor was there any other properties around for overflow and it is not a convention center. I asked for a luggage cart but was told the bell hops have to do it and stay with it and felt like it was forced on us then had to tip when we could have handled it ourselves. Walls are thin as well and no microwave in the room. Not sure we&#39;ll stay here again because spending an extra $300 for our stay, I can find some place cheaper on the pet fee and no parking fee. I do not mind paying a pet fee, but that was extreme. There&#39;s nice hotels closer to Downtown Branson that I&#39;d look into next time or rent a cabin&#47;chalet.\n",

Booking.com should have made it known at time of booking that an additional pet fee was required. I chose this lodge from the several in the same area...in part because it was the most expensive and had slightly higher reviews. I could have chosen a cheaper hotel with our without the pet fee. For a night&#39;s stay, it wasn&#39;t really worth the extra money I paid. It was a standard motel type room with two double beds...I only needed one queen bed. Standard, unexceptional hotel style furniture. Nice staff. This is my childhood home town which I left 53 years ago and was there saying hello to my family who are in Kenosha. So...it was ok...but again, I could have saved up to $50 by chosing any of the other properties either in downtown Kenosha where I normally stay (but the place now has rotten reviews and must have gone way down since the last time I stayed there), or any other the other branded properties in the area. BOOKING.COM....I THINK YOU ARE BEING BAMBOOZELED BY PHONY REVIEWS! This is NOT the first time we chose a property based on EXAGERRATED REVIEWS!. Too many exaggerated reviews on Booking.com.

Third time we have been here and looking forward to finding time to make another visit in the future. While Pohang is not on the main travel route for many tourists, we think it should be. Always a surprise around the corner and an authentic atmosphere not easy to find in the larger mega-cities. And when visiting Pohang, one address to stay: Browndot Terrace. Pet friendly and for those travelling without pets, the hotel has a truly unique collection of very nice other options.\n",

Some kind samaritans with dogs directed us to Pamela Angel.  Even though their reception was closed as it was late and their policy strictly allowing no pets, they were happy to go out of their way to accommodate us and make an exception.  Perhaps because of Tet or they realized our plight.  We are very grateful for them bending the rules for us. We were not even charged extra to have the dog with us. The room was spacious, clean, the bedding fresh and we woke up well rested. Also, they have decent and safe parking and pretty close to waterfront on the gorgeous archipelago. 👍🐕  I reiterate my gratitude to the owner and the team for letting us stay with our dog even when it&#39;s against their policy. 🙏\n",

There was also a coffee machine that you can access any time of day , along with a water dispenser in the dining area. The Crown Plaza is next door , so you can also access all their restaurants.

I waited a minute and then said hello, a woman appeared and said &quot;ring the bell, don&#39;t yell&quot; and pointed to a small business size card with a smaller button the size of a pencil eraser on the counter. I had to laugh, like I had just been punked, but she was serious faced and gave us a 2nd floor room with no elevator. I had sent a message ahead of time saying we had a puppy in a cage but no one replied. We had to lug all our stuff up the stairs to the second floor and down the hall. Large pet area out back could use better lighting and easier to get to from the main part of the hotel. Probably won&#39;t stay again on our way back through.\n",

      "Positive: Property was represented fairly well online, the location was great, and you can tell they are updating their facilities. The housekeeping and handyman staff were super friendly and helpful. It was a relatively comfortable and affordable stay for a group of 5 adults and 2 small dogs.\n",
      "Negative: 1) Not the properties fault, but there were several families around us with small children that were running and screaming outside on the balconies and riding the elevator up and down until well after 11 pm.   2) I love that it’s a pet friendly place. However, I traveled with 2 small dogs (8lbs and under) and the pet fee for 4 nights was $200.00. This is a pretty high fee considering most AirBNB’s and VRBO rentals are a $50-$75 flat pet fee per stay.  3) Check out is 11 am but our key cards were cut off at 10:30 while we were loading the car. Office stay seemed bothered when we asked for more towels on our 3rd day and when we questioned our key card being cut off before check out time.\n",

      "Negative: I didn&#39;t like that breakfast wasn&#39;t included in the price. I only found this out after I had paid the non-refundable booking payment in full. For the price paid I would have expected breakfast also. The rooms are also in need of updating. The carpet was a little dirty and the paint was due a refresh. Although we did stay with our clean toy poodle and we were allocated a &#39;pet friendly&#39; room which may excuse the state of the carpet somewhat but I didn&#39;t feel comfortable walking around the room without wearing footwear. Also one of the bed mattresses was too long for the bed base and was hung over the bottom of the bed. This wasn&#39;t expected for the price paid although the welcoming with our pet, friendliness of the staff and high quality of the restaurant food made up for this somewhat. If breakfast was included in the price I would probably have overlooked these minor points and left a higher rating.\n",

The place is pet friendly, gated and very spacious; i could let my pet dog off the leash for a while where it could get around freely. The room was very clean, with a small fridge and tea making facilities. There was no information as to whether tea making facilities were complimentary, but i only stayed overnight.  I dined at agritourism and the food was abundant, fresh and genuine. My dog was with me all the time including in the restaurant.  The bed was super comfy, and I had a good night sleep.  The breakfast consisted of cold cuts, bread, hard boiled eggs, two varieties of cakes, and three types of refrigerated juices.\n",
      "Negative: I would have preferred clearer information on the tea making facilities in the room.  The room was cold and the heating was slow. To be fair I am not familiar with radiator heating so I may have used it incorrectly. This said it would be an opportunity for the property to check that the heating is functional correctly.  The water in the shower was not hot and took several minutes for the first slightly warm water to come out of the shower.  On the positive side, the space inside the shower cubicle is on the larger side, so i could turn easily inside the shower.  I did not bring any of the above to the attention of the management for the sole reason that I stayed at the location for only one night.\n",

Free car parking is a bonus in an area where street parking is scarce. Hotel room was clean but basic with a terrace to sit out on. Plenty of bars &amp; restaurants in the area, so many you are spoilt for choice.\n",
      "Negative: The shower over the bath was difficult to access as it had a really high step to get over. The soap dispenser didnt work so take your own soap &amp; shower gel. Beds were hard. Even though I asked for a sunny terrace on my booking, we were given a room (number 9) that although it had a sittable terrace, it never saw the sun and consequently was cold. Dont bother with breakfast, it is poor value for €6 each. Much better, cheaper breakfasts are available near the beachfront.\n",

Michael, the manager, his wife Terri, breakfast hostess, and Sony, were so friendly, and helpful!  I complimented Michael on the quality maintenance.

Alex greeted us warmly when we arrived at the hotel and the check in process was very smooth. Room is spacious and clean. Free drinking water is provided inside the room. Smart TV, movies, and books are also available to use. WiFi connection is also great. Another plus for us is that the property is pet friendly. They even provided us rope to use so our dog can have longer leash and explore the nice place without the worry of him running around the entire town :D    The property is clean and well maintained. It is a &quot;rocky&quot; beach but definitely not a problem for us. The stones and rocks are not sharp and still relatively safe to walk or swim barefoot. We are still able to swim and enjoy the water. Even our dog Kairo, enjoyed it too.    Last but not the least, all staff and crew are very accomodating to our requests and in general very friendly! We just had an amazing stay overall considering the weather was not at its best. How much more in the middle of summer? Exactly. Will definitely come back! :)\n",

The rooms are pretty basic but they are always very clean and comfortable. I love that they are pet friendly so our pup can join us.

Exceptionally comfy beds. Great shower! Ten out of ten for cleanliness. Inspired decor, charming, original, lovely, creative, refreshing! So happy to have found this little gem. Hosts and staff were delightful. Charming community atmosphere. Hosts have a definite sense of community responsibility and seem very kind and thoughtful. Huge pub menu, catering for all tastes and diets. The breakfasts, I must stress were perfect - it was the perfect portions as well as the lovely flavours and skilled cooking (usually a cooked breakfast is too massive to enjoy, Penny does brekkie so well). Incredibly pet friendly - our little dog was made to feel comfortable and included and there were no rules, just trust. Location ace for access to the lakes and journey home.\n",

All the staff were friendly and helpful - with a well cooked breakfast with decent ingredients both days. Our room was clean and there was plenty of hot water.   The thatched roof  full-of-history feel was very cool and apart from taller people needing to mind your head, created a good atmosphere inside and lots of room outdoors for kids&#47;children and fresh air folk.  The staff were refreshingly polite and took inclusivity to heart, clearly making all their guests feel equally welcome - and it is a pet friendly accommodation :) Although we were there for work, the Inn&#39;s location made it attractive for walkers and of course river boats. Tasty evening meals were still available at 9.30 and ours were satisfyingly sized.\n",

However after researching this property, we had envisioned sitting in adirondack chairs around the fire pit with our dog, meeting other people, eating from the food truck and maybe listening to live music. What happened was that our dog was not allowed in those areas and we had to sit in an area shared with kids playing ping pong, no  live music and the Trans Fat food truck was counter to the &quot;healthy&quot; vibe the property had.( the dumplings were delicious , but the majority of the menu was deep fried) For whatever reason,  we had mistakenly thought that the area by the John Wayne mural was a dog play area.\n",

Had to call the desk on one occasion due to a dog in a room near us that barked constantly (I am assuming he was scared because he was left alone in a strange room).  Apparently I was not the only person to complain because the desk clerk said they had already called the owners.      Your facility needs to invest in better fitting sheets for the king size beds.

TIP: We parked our car at the Tesco’s parking lot, but you have to book it in advance (link provided by Oban Apartments), however, you need a UK number to make an account via the link&#47;app and, if like us, you have an international number, you can buy a pay as you go SIM card at Tesco.\n",

I am about 1.76 and my feet were hanging out of the bed.  - We had an apartment in the middle floor and on the first two nights the guests upstairs were very considerate and quiet, however on our third night (new guests, I suppose) were very loud, and for some reason started having what sounded like an aggressive argument which snapped my partner and I out of our sleep, around 1:30 am.

Some bed pillows were uncomfortable (hard) but two were nice.    Soap - Now this is a biggy!!  I have not seen those tiny, itty bitty soaps since the 1950s&#47;1960s.  This is not the place to employ &#39;retro&#39;.  Very VERY frustrating to try and get any soap at all onto a washcloth.  I did call the front desk upon arrival to inquire where the &quot;bath&quot; soaps were.  I was told: &quot;that&#39;s it&quot;.  I only regret I didn&#39;t shop and purchase a bar of soap but continued to struggle with those ridiculously TINY little slabs of soap.  Something definitely should be done to correct that.  Maybe travelers staying at your hotel should be forewarned when booking to bring their own soap.     Pet Area - Your hotel advertises as a &quot;pet friendly&quot; hotel. I am paying an extra daily fee for that. I would expect a better area to walk our dog around.  The doggy &#39;park&#39; is OK..but some dogs need more open exercise.  But with all the construction around and debris....it&#39;s dangerous to walk your dog around the hotel area.\n",

      "Positive: Good location not too far from the centre. Pets were acceptable\n",
      "Negative: For a pet friendly hotel they weren’t very accommodating. No fridge in the room so couldn’t keep the dog food. When we asked if reception could keep the food in the fridge we were told it wasn’t feasible. Now I understand they didn’t want to because of certain rules however this should have been flagged ahead of arrival so we could properly prepare.  No phones in the room also meant that every time we needed something we had to get the lift from the 5th floor to go to reception. One time we asked for an extra duvet and they said they would bring it within 30mins. This wasn’t the case and we had to leave for our dinner booking. We let them know we were leaving and that we did not want anyone entering the room because we had left our dog in there, as well as having hung the do not disturb sign. Two hours later, I came back and I asked if I could get the duvet only to be told someone was leaving it in the room. Lo and behold, they had ignored our ask to no enter the room and had just gone in.  The ceiling was also badly soundproofed. When in bed we could hear running and stamping as well as the base from some loudspeakers.  I would say that overall it was disappointing and definitely not worth the money. Unless you book early and have really low rates I would not recommend. You can find better hotels for the same if not cheaper.\n",

This was pretty absurd, because our friend had a dog with him and we couldn&#39;t sit and relax ANYWHERE since only the main restaurant is pet friendly and it is closed at this time. So we couldn&#39;t sit at the cafe with the dog, where the pizza was available, and all other areas were close. This was for sure the worst problem of our stay, we had to sit outside in the cold since we couldn&#39;t leave the dog alone in the room but we couldn&#39;t sit with the dog anywhere :(\n",

The suite was very spacious for our family and I loved that the hotel is pet friendly, so we were able to bring our cat along with us.\n",
      "Negative: I didn’t like that there were ants in the first room or that in the upgraded room, the mattresses on the bed and the sleeper sofa were very uncomfortable. Overall my family and I still enjoyed our trip and the room. However there weren’t any pillows for the sleeper sofa, so my daughters used one from our bed and they went downstairs to get another one from the front desk. But when we checked out and housekeeping came to clean our rooms, they reported that we’d stolen a pillow from the room. As a result, instead of them calling us to inquire about the pillow, they charged $20 to my card for it. Never mind the fact that whoever stayed there before us could have taken the pillow, or maybe the pillow needed replaced and someone forgot to replace it. So in spite of the fact that there were ants in the first room, and no swimming pool for our daughters to enjoy, I was still prepared to give the hotel a good review and consider staying there again. But after finding out that my family was  falsely accused of stealing a pillow of all things and my card was charged for no reason, I have decided that we will not be staying at this hotel when we plan our next trip to Green Bay.\n",

      "Positive: Breakfast included warm croissants with delicious jam and cream. The drawback is that it took awhile for service and they serve one or two people at a time, so something to keep in mind if you have to get going. The staff was very helpful and open to feedback. For instance, one of the batches of fresh coffee had grounds in it. As soon as I pointed it out the staff member made a fresh pot just for me. One one of the nights, part of the door to our room broke and was unable to fully open, and one of the staff was very helpful in finding a new room for me. He even gave me a room that had its own bathroom because it happened to be available! The rooms were fairly clean and the wifi worked well with no issues. One of the rooms we booked didn&#39;t have a working radiator and it happened to be a cold spring night, so the same staff member promptly found a portable heater for our room. I also liked that it was pet friendly and we had no issues with my little dog. Skittles mostly kept to herself except for the occasional staring match with the puppy and keeping a cautious distance. I also liked that the hotel was easily accessible by BART and then tram from the airport.\n",
      "Negative: While the neighbourhood was relatively central to a few things (Chinatown, Union Square, and the tram could take us to a few locations), I didn&#39;t realize that it might not be the best place to take one&#39;s dog for a walk at night. The puppy himself was not interested in going for a stroll in that neighbourhood, simply did his business and was eager to go back inside. There were no violent incidents, mostly some intoxicated individuals on their way home. The hotel itself felt secure in that area. The building itself is older, a bit modest, simple but quaint and cozy in its own way, with an older-style elevator between floors, which I liked, but might not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea.\n",

The TV has Direct TV with great channels. There is carpet between the beds that is very old, it has a unique almost damp or musty smell that was unpleasant. The outside of the hotel in some hallways and walkways is not the cutest, but it was very well lit and despite the look of these areas being a little beat down by the Galveston wind and sun, I still felt very safe.

The shower grid is broken, the mirror in the bathroom hangs way  up on the wall, even a very tall person wont be able to use it, the pair of curtains hang on different rails so the one is higher than the other one. The one coffee mug was cracked in the inside. It is not a ground floor unit, there are 2 big flights of stairs to the front door and even if it says pet friendly, there was no gate that can be closed on our deck so our dog had to be on a leash the entire time. The pool is not private, more than one unit share the pool. It was very difficult to get past the main entrance on arrival and departure as there was something wrong with the gate. And last, one of the owners or their family members loudly called out to her own dogs at 6am, walking passed the units of sleeping guests.\n",

      "Positive: Pleased they accepted pets booked ahead.  We had guinea pigs in a cage.  Very nice breakfast. Rear door from car park so you can access your pet friendly room without going through the main hotel &#47; bar space.    You can&#39;t get a room with the estuary view with pets but its on the doorstep to enjoy anyway.  We have stayed here at least 6 times before we had pets so are delighted we  can still come now.\n",

We stayed on the sixth floor with a balcony and it was pet friendly in a prime location -- directly across from Gyro Beach. The elevators were quick. Digital key access went smoothly once registered on the day of check in, which is at 4:00pm.  Parking is an additional $10&#47;night, which is less than a typical daily rate.  There are a few attached restaurants, which was very convenient!  Hope to stay here again when the construction across the street is complete, but it was fun for kiddo to watch the cranes.

Had to shut the unit off at night because it was too noisy.  We were “warned” at checkin that they were a “pet friendly” hotel which I thought was odd, until I saw the number of large dogs staying at this hotel.  Hotel only occupies about five of the 18 floors in this building.  The rest of the floors are permanent residences.\n",

When we arrived the staff were nice, and we got an upgrade to the original&#47;old wing! The interior of the original building is beautiful and there&#39;s plenty to enjoy just strolling around - including a small chapel and a tearoom etc. The grounds are pretty decent and there&#39;s chairs and tables outdoors to enjoy an impromptu picnic or dinner. It felt very peaceful for our stay which was lovely.    There was a member of staff to help us with the lift as well and guide us round the rooms and halls, which can get a bit maze-like (but personally, for an original building, I really don&#39;t mind it).    Wonderful medium swimming pool with sauna, steam room and 4-person jacuzzi - open early in the day till late allowing us to swim before breakfast. And breakfast was good - plenty of space for everyone, hot food and cereals. There were some vegan&#47;veggie options that I think cost extra and were on request, but there was alternative milks and options for those on restricted or plant based diets in cold food etc.    We plan to visit again someday, with our dog as there are pet friendly spaces too which is fantastic.\n",

I was really impressed a year ago when I stayed so when she had the other knee done I booked some place. Staff is WONDERFUL!! Older property but kept nice. Best value for $$ in area. I love they are pet friendly, even tho I didn’t have mine with me and love the parquet flooring!! That makes a world of difference in the smell of rooms!! Breakfast was good…the women working in kitchen were just angels. The area it’s in is well kept and lit, parking lot was kept clean and neat and includes smoking areas (2) out front. I don’t smoke but it’s nice that those that do have somewhere to go and not throw cig butts all over the ground.\n",

      "Positive: We stayed in early June, in the Lodge, Deluxe Queen room. This resort has so much going on that even though we were in a mega tourist destination with activities galore we still chose to spend a significant time actually at the resort playing games and swimming and enjoying the grounds. The room was spacious and immaculate. The “Tent” area with 2 beds in it for the kids was so cute and very much enjoyed by ours. They had their own TV as well in that nook. There is a giant fire pit out back on the events lawn and the kids really loved roasting marshmallows out there. The sticks and marshmallows were provided by the attendant at the fire pit. This place is super clean, fun, and in an awesome location off the main strip in Pigeon Forge. The restaurant and bar were very good, good food, great options for kids too. The only drawback I had was the resort is uber pet friendly. For some that’s probably a plus but for my wife’s allergies not so much. Dogs are everywhere it seems. But having said that, our room was very clean and they have done a great job minimizing the pet dander&#47;allergens.\n",

The hotel is indeed pet friendly.   There is an amazing garden with barbeque.   The hotel is 5 min walking distance from the beach, the path is picturesque, but might not be suitable for people with disabilities.  On the beach there are private sunbeds for the guests. Not many other people there, which was nice.   And we sipmly loved the 2 beautiful horses that welcome you when you arrive at the property 😊\n",

      "Negative: When we usually stay at the Inn at St. Mary&#39;s, we usually stay on the east side, on the first floor. The &quot;pet friendly&quot; room we usually get has a microwave, and the room we were given #121 did not have one. The room we usually get is more decorative and has a &quot;homey&quot; feel, while the room, #121, we got, was very bland and stark. It was a room for &quot;disabled&quot; guests, so the shower wasn&#39;t as nice as the other room(s) we&#39;ve stayed in. For the price we paid, it was let down. However, this is the first time we didn&#39;t experience a wonderful stay, but since we&#39;ve stayed in other rooms on previous visits, we&#39;ll continue to make future accommodations at the Inn at St. Mary&#39;s, but now know to request certain rooms.\n",

Upon arrival, and after having paid for our booking online, the receptionists tried to charge us a hidden cost for bringing our cat, despite the fact that the hotel is advertised as pet friendly and no additional charges were required from us when we politely notified that we were bringing a cat. As I mentioned before, we liked the facilities for the most part, the proximity of the hotel to the beach and the pier, the sea view and the sauna, but we found the service was very disappointing.\n",

A huge variety available that changed every day (meat&#47;fish&#47;vegetarian dishes).      Pet friendly: the most pet-friendly hotel we&#39;ve stayed at. We were welcomed with a nice fleece blanket for our dog, a water dish, a food dish (full of dog kibble), a little toy and more.  Really made us feel welcome.

      "Negative: I stayed here for a little over a week while I was in between leases and the afternoon and night staff were absolutely awful. I had never been treated so badly as a guest of a hotel anywhere I have ever stayed than at this Oyo townhome hotel. This was my first and hopefully will be my last time staying at this hotel. The staff watch you like you are on house arrest or something and the man working night shift is the worst of them. During check-in he did not smile at all, no type of welcoming attitude or aura. They did not have a cart available for me to bring in my stuff and take to my room. I had quite a few bags since my storage was closed for the night but the night shift man told me everything would have to be brought in through the front even though my room was all the way at the back door. So my brother and I had to lug everything through the hotel with no cart. I called ahead of time to check whether the hotel was pet friendly and was told it is not, but immediately after checking in as I walked down the hallway back toward my brother’s car to get the rest of my things (he drove me to the hotel &amp; was keeping my dog and cat for the week) the night shift front desk man said to me, “if you bring that dog in here we’re going to have a problem.” I hadn’t said anything to him and my dog was still sitting in the car because my brother was keeping her for the week. I was confused why he would threaten me when I hadn’t said anything about my dog but I responded by saying, “yea…. She’s going home with my brother.” That was the 1st rude incident and I hadn’t been there more than 20 minutes. A couple days after I ordered a pizza for dinner. All guests and delivery people are required to come through the front door which wasn’t an issue. But a couple hours after, a friend of mine came to visit me at my room. When I went up front to meet my friend I was told I needed to “reduce my traffic.\n",

The hotel also has a restaurant and a bar, where I enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast and a really refreshing morning juice, before proceeding to the Airport. Ibis Airport Sydney is a great option for travelers who need a quick and easy stay near the airport.    They did a fantastic job of welcoming our pet dog and giving him a comfortable bed and treats. Along with water bowls and a separate bowl for food, along with a towel to wipe him down after he came back from a walk.\n",

It is spacious and the shower room was huge, however, the pet smell is clearly present, though I&#39;m allergic to pet smell and dander, it didn&#39;t bother us. The pool was great! I like it that the tower is just right in front of the pool. The hotel is centrally located right where a lot of fun activities are happening!\n",

The lift was the big bonus as it allowed me to enjoy a high floor, which I like for views, but usually have to forego when travelling with my elderly mum.  Being pet friendly was also a major plus.  Parking caused us no issue, even over a busy Bank Holiday weekend. Great communication from hosts who really care that their guests enjoy their stay. I would highly recommend.\n",

      "Positive: Food - the food was fantastic. The scallops, langoustines, steak and banoffee pie at dinner especially, and the sausages at breakfast. Small buffet but had everything- cereal, pastries, yoghurt, fruit and then a great selection to order  Pet friendliness- we were travelling with our lab and Loch Fyne is probably the best pet friendly hotel we have been to. He was welcomed everywhere with us which was just so refreshing. The walks at Inverary castle grounds were absolutely fantastic also.  Spa - lovely. The pool was so warm and it was mostly adults which was nice and relaxing  Value for money - we felt for the rate it was excellent value for money\n",
      "Negative: Our only two comments were the changing area at the pool is unisex and quite small. We wished we had came down in our robe and got showered in the room.  Also the bed in the standard room was quite small - my partner is 6ft 4 so it was a little bit uncomfortable for him but it wouldnt put us off going back as this is something we find often\n",

      "Negative: For what I paid for I was fine to rate 9&#47;10 (if it had been much more I&#39;d probably have revised it to a 8). Overall nothing that&#39;s a deal breaker but if I could be picky:    - The budget pet villa I stayed at good value nevertheless but did have a shared wall. Everyone tries to be courteous but sometimes things can&#39;t be helped 100%. If someone talks in a raised voice you can probably make out most of it with decent hearing next door. One of the neighbours also left their yappy dog at times with the tv on alone so you can hear the tv through the wall and their dog got super nervous and barked everytime we made the slightest noise just light footsteps. Thankfully it was just temporary around dinner time for a few hours so nothing you can&#39;t deal with!     - Bit of a noticeable draft comes in through a gap on the doorframe makes the room rather cool on a colder night  - Bed underneath the very large and only window in the room (again you can feel a bit of a draft  but not much to be done about that) what is annoying is the very bright light that shine into the villa I stayed at that is just above your head when sleeping (the villa and window was faced right next to the laundry and toilets) through the cheap rollerblinds that seemed to be locked to prevent it from going down a teeny bit more to block more light and due to the overall design of these type of blinds it does little to block out light (so be aware if you&#39;re super light sensitive)  - Traffic in the park can get a bit tight (but campspots and residences are therefore maximised) just be careful with turning around and getting out in the morning etc as different cars and caravans may have popped up overnight    I did get used to all of the above after the first night but just to help future guests know...\n",

The fire dept is right beside this hotel, so anytime of day&#47;night, you could hear sirens.Luckily I only heard them during the day. Bring your own plates&#47;cutlery etc for cooking in the microwave. For the free breakfast, I suggest getting there before 9-9:30 (closes at 10), otherwise there may not be any hard boiled eggs or eggo waffles.

Unlike some of the reviews I read previously, we did have laundry soap available for our stay, which was appreciated. Good quality shampoo (no conditioner or lotion) is provided. The air conditioning worked great. Netflix on the TV was a nice surprise.\n",
      "Negative: None of these were surprises based on previous reviews and we came prepared to either deal with and&#47;or manage our expectations accordingly. We brought ear plugs due to the noise of the busy street which helped tremendously. We also brought laundry soap (which we ended up not needing). Issues we read about before which were the same during our stay include having only one dish towel for both drying hands and drying dishes (there is no dish drying rack or dishwasher). There is also no hot pad for taking hot items out of the oven so the towel has to serve that purpose as well. A hot pad, dish drying rack, and a couple of dish towels would make a world of difference at not a great expense for the owners. These items would especially be nice for a longer stay and for those who plan on using the kitchen for cooking the majority of their meals. Overall though for the property being pet friendly, renovated nicely but still keeping historic details, the great communication of the hosts, having good AC, being right next to the metro (with a large amount of grass just across the street, which was great for ease of taking our dog outside), and the value for the money, we would definitely stay again.\n",

The staff was preparing more, however, we did have to wait awhile.  I would just suggest, when a large party such as a team of hungry college athletes is staying, try and schedule more people or start preparing more food earlier rather than later.  Also, maybe open a meeting room for additional seating.  We stood for 20 minutes waiting for the food to come out and then had to eat while standing since there were so many people in the dining area.  This is just a planning&#47;logistics suggestion.

So comfortable with amazing luxury pillows, blankets and duvets! The couches and outdoor furniture was extremely comfortable and relaxing!  The short 2min walk to the beach was lovely and the beach itself is clean with 2 little lagoons to swim and snorkel in as well.  There is nothing to fault with this accommodation or the host.

The rooms it’s self was fine for him but  shower was an issue as there was a step up to the cubicle with a narrow opening on the door which meant he couldn’t use the  shower . I’m around 5’8 and the shower rail didn’t go over my head so I couldn’t wash my hair.   Access to the main hotel is up a flight of steps at the front of the building and we were told that we could have access to the car park at the rear to gain access to the hotel. That was fine however the car park is exceptionally small with one disabled parking space which really is not big enough for people to get in and out of their car- I don’t know what would happen if there was more than one disabled person using the hotel ?  The ramp leads down to the hotel fine but it is very steep to come up and my rather fit husband couldn’t push him self up it - luckily hotel staff were able to help him when I wasn’t there ,\n",

It&#39;s about 30 seconds from the beach and a short walk to the main town and other areas. The host gave us the lockbox combination and it was no problem to find the keys outside the main door.

I had the room with the shower, which was very nice and had shampoo and shower gel included. The price paid for a weekend between 4 people was very good value and it was a great base for the weekend as we could cook a pizza indoors and come and go very easily.

There were no bin bags in the small bins in each room and the bath was full of bits and dust when we arrived which was a bit off-putting. The shower vent was also quite dirty. The sponge provided for washing up was dirty and needed replacing. The kerb appeal of the flat block is poor, there are wheelie bins all over and the front was quite scruffy and overgrown - it would have been nice for a tidier entrance and better first impression.

The adjacent road consisted of a beautiful car ride alongside the Ausable River and falls.  The facility and rooms were both clean and updated and had a wonderful cabin-like feel.  The office had an assortment of games to borrow for added fun.  No one was present at check-in, but the guest&#39;s last names were posted with the accompanying room number on the TV screen in the office. No keys or cards were needed to enter your room as it was a number pad preprogrammed to the last 4 digits of your phone...NICE!  There were 2 pools onsite...a kiddie pool with fountain and  the other with a diving board (and a surprisingly 9-foot depth).  Both well maintained.  A community fire pit was located in back between the motel and river.  It was definitely a pet friendly motel with supplied waste removal bags.\n",

Check in at 4pm is a little late for most people coming in, and seems extreme for a check out time of 10am.   2. there was no &#39;do not disturb&#39; sign in the room to let cleaners know that you dont want your room cleaned, which was odd. However we simply let the cleaner know and she was happy to accept.   3. Breakfast gets busy from 8:30-9:30am , and things run out quickly (bowls, glasses, water, coffee etc...). The staff were really working hard to keep up, but I heard a few grumbles from the guests.   Overall, we had a lovely , chill stay, thank you to all the staff.\n",

We don&#39;t watch TV but we read a lot and the insufficient lighting made it difficult to read.   The water hose near the beach access was not working so we could not wash the sand off our dog before re-entering the hotel.  We had to use our own towels to knock off as much sand as we could, but it would have been nice if the water was turned on at that spigot.  I hated tracking sand into the hotel   but it couldn&#39;t be helped.     The fitness room had only 1 cardio machine working.  The room is pretty small given the size of the hotel.     The check-in around 4 pm was crowded with only one staff person and I could tell she was stressed because she was a bit sharp.  Later, though she was more friendly.

The window fan had to be connected with an extension cord from behind the bed which barely reached the fan cord. It would be helpful to have a room humidifier to help with the air dryness in the area. Tough to sleep in any area at 9000 feet so an airconditioning system verses a window fan would be helpful to keep the noise outside in the day to a minimum. Also one could lower the blinds completely verses leaving a large bottom area open so as to operate the fan.\n",

Location wise was in a lovey part of the city with good links to other spots.     Don’t expect anything flash or fancy, but it was worth more than I paid in my opinion and I don’t say that lightly. Have stayed in some awful spots for more.

We struggled with the exterior access door as well as our room door.  Neither card performed consistently.  We tried all the little tricks- quick swipe, slow swipe, swipe and pause, then open.  What worked one time, failed the next.  Sometimes we tried and tried until it worked.  Other times, someone leaving let us in.  There was an elderly woman with a walker complaining about this at the desk who described exactly what we were experiencing.  Staff seemed very reluctant to assist her.  They told her it could be tricky and to keep trying.  The ice machine on the second floor was broken and the elevator nearest our room was not working, but we prefer the stairs anyway.  The breakfast was strictly carbs.  We focus on protein at all meals and there were no options.  Even the carbs were very processed, no fresh fruit, no yogurt, no hot cereal, no boiled eggs.  The parking lot had lots of litter.  Used goves, bottles full of what looked like urine, old trash that looked like it had been there for months, not something just recently, recklessly discarded.

I had one particular displeasing situation: During my stay there was one night where next to me stayed a family with a dog. This dog barked very loudly many times throughout the night (woke me up several times until 2 or 3 am). I understand that this is a tricky situation but I was here on business and basically lost a night of sleep. The very concerning aspect to me was that the hotel had no solutions. I was very displeased with the manager&#39;s attitude (basically looking at me with no expression and was actually the desk employee trying to come up with solutions). She told me they can&#39;t control the dog. Fair enough you can&#39;t, but it&#39;s not acceptable that we are paying these rates and things like this are happening. There has to be a balance between being pet friendly and it not disturbing everyone around. To me this should be common sense. I was left wondering what would have happened if those guests had stayed more than one night. Unacceptable that a hotel of this caliber has no solution for this.    Would just like to add that despite my strong feelings about this particular situation, everything else was great.\n",

It is a pet friendly property and we did not have any issue with the dogs we encountered. It was quite at night as your &quot;neighbors&quot; follow the rules.

With the beautifully maintained Victorian buildings lining the streets and their well-manicured landscaping I was enamored by the calm I felt every time I walked outside.  I walked several blocks up the street where I passed a variety of shopping options, restaurants, bars, arcades... when I notice Sutter’s Fort State Historic Park and State Indian Museum’s were right across the street I checked out the Fort for free,.  The property itself is clean and classy. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The complimentary breakfast is decent and satisfying.

We requested adjacent rooms but were not given  6. The breakfast spread was chaotic on the weekend  7. One suggestion is to provide a room clock in every room  The reason we come back here every-time is because we bring our cat with us &amp; have been given upgrades, this time after spending 80k, we felt it wasn’t value for money, so might consider exploring another pet friendly hotel next time.\n",

We love the room and its amenities, we did compare TownePlace Suites with other surrounding hotels, and this hotel is still one of the best around Titusville. I love how it has a mini kitchen but with a regular fridge plus a dishwasher in the room. It feels like a mini apartment, feels like home. Check out process was fast as well. Most importantly, its location is strategic, close to restaurants, and only 5 mins from our home so we know that we can always rely on TownePlace Suites.\n",
      "Negative: This is our second stay. The first stay was during the hurricane season, everything was perfect, the front desk was great and we fell in love with TownePlace Suites instantly. This one was also a nice stay. However, when we just checked into the room, I noticed that my black backpack was covered with fur once I put it down on the couch, probably dog fur. I also spotted quite a lot of fur on the corner of the bathroom floor and I had to wipe the floor just to make sure I didn&#39;t bring the fur to the bed. I understand that the hotel is pet friendly and that&#39;s wonderful, but I wish the cleaning could be better. Luckily I only have a mild allergy to dog fur.  I wish the room was more soundproof. You could hear the neighboring guests pretty clearly, the stomps, the shower, the door slams, the children screaming and shouting. The outside noise was pretty loud too especially if your room is close to the highway.\n",

Also, the decor is very modern and homely with a very spacious living room area, and kitchen, meaning that you can still share a room with the rest of the family whilst preparing some food for everyone, or even whilst dining.

The apartment was spotless and fresh.   I would definitely recommend this apartment.   We spent the night as we were travelling down from Liverpool to visit Many Tears Animal Rescue in Llanelli (30 mins away) to adopt a puppy and we didn’t want to do the return journey in one day.   Obviously the major plus for me was it was pet friendly, my boy isn’t the smallest dog in the world (95kg and like a giraffe!) but there was plenty of floor space for him to lay where he wanted. I did have to block the top of the stairs with the dining chairs as he thought it was great to go down the stairs and ask to keep being taken for a walk!!\n",

Multiple areas to sit and relax by a fireplace visit with family&#47; friends, read a book, play games, etc. My sister and I enjoyed playing a couple games of cribbage on the super comfy furniture by the front lobby fireplace.   John, Jack, and Laney were all fantastic hosts!!! John and Jack would remotely open the front door for us when they saw us coming which was SUPER nice and helpful when our arms were full l! Laney is a SUPER talented singer&#47; songwriter &#47;guitarist who performs in the Nest Lounge at Open Hearth on some Saturdays. Her talent will blow your mind!!!! Beautiful voice!!! She should be the next American Idol!!!  Breakfast is included and had a great variety of selections. Nice warm pool and toasty hot tub! Outdoor firepits, 6 acres of open and wooded grounds to walk on.   This is a family owned and operated lodge. Pride of ownership definitely shows in everything they do and all the little extra touches. We were told the grandfather did the beautiful woodwork accents on the lodge hall walls. They have a nicely stocked pantry of food and beverages available all hours for purchase. If they see you during the day out and about the lodge they will ask you if there&#39;s anything you need and how your day is.

Has everything you need but would expect a bit better given it’s a spa hotel. Has more of an average travelodge feel.  Swimming pool is nice but again not as nice as you’d expect for a spa hotel.  Staff are lovely but some aren’t overly effective - slow to realize I was wanting to check in for breakfast on every morning. Had to go looking for someone for the spa check in. They seem to double up on their jobs so more of a management issue than an individual issue.    Review of one expensive evening bar food and cocktail: disappointing.\n",

I love the town of Duenas, always good for a walk around, and the people in the hotel and the town are friendly. The food at the &quot;sister hotel&quot; is good and the staff friendly and efficient. It is economical but with room sizes, beds, facilities etc. that are much better than &quot;economy&quot; class. There is more than adequate parking, so no problems there, and the hotel is easy to find, being just a short way off the motorway, but just far enough that a good night&#39;s sleep in the comfortable beds is not disturbed.\n",

The bathroom was right next to my room and it was also very clean and had a good shower, the shower pump was a bit noisy but worked fine. All staff were very friendly and helpful and made you feel like an old friend visiting, this is a very busy place and very dog friendly, it&#39;s simply just a really nice place to visit. Breakfast was really nice, I had the full English breakfast which was very good value, very nice coffee with all the normal juices, toast and jam stuff, it&#39;s recommended that you book for your breakfast and evening meal as its a very popular place but if you don&#39;t like me the staff will do everything to fit you in, you will not be disappointed, car park space is very limited in or next to the hotel but there is on street parking close by and it&#39;s free from what I could see, can&#39;t wait to go back.\n",

Also they project themselves as a pub or restaurant with rooms . whatever they may say, in in my World they are a Hotel and should try to offer full Hotel service- you do get an iron and an ironing board in the room , so can press a jacket or iron a shirt, which is a benefit. The only other aspect that I have noticed is that often on opening the door into the room on checking in the safe has been left liked by the previous occupier, which, as I am often a Kate arrival due to flight tines , I have to wait until the next morning to have it reopened - an inconvenience , rather than a complaint - other than that , excellent quality to price , dog friendly, I love dogs and staff who will go 110% to make your stay memorable !\n",

The lady who sorts everything out called Julie is fantastic, she is so lovely and nothing is too much trouble. She really goes the extra mile with everything.  There was a lovely dog walk around the site. My wife and i will definitely be back this year, and my brother and his wife said they will get one next to us as they liked the look of it so much.

      "Negative: Mostly it was the ridiculous amount of admin needed. I wouldn’t book via the property agent again. It was offensive in the end. Email after email after email, mostly directing me to a third party website and then asking for additional credit card info which felt far too scammy to be real. Emails saying we give you the key code 24 hours in advance to emails saying we let you have it an hour before hand. So much stress. Really thought it was a scam at that point.  Especially when any email I sent asking for clarification on when the code would actually come wasn’t responded to.  Then on ‘check out’ (most people are just allowed to leave but not here, oh no,) so on check out I had to list the time I was leaving but we’d left the night before and there wasn’t an option for that so when I didn’t comply with my orders I got a text reminding me to it. I’d had enough at that point. Add to that the threatening emails about making sure the correct bins were used at all times or there would be a fine (but not actually saying where the correct bin is which was hidden behind a tree on the green away from the house).  Before we checked in I got an email which said if I’d have booked directly (I googled them. I couldn’t find them) I’d have got a bottle of Prosecco but because I am but a lowly booking.com guest I was essentially being punished and wasn’t entitled to one. I own a holiday home and would never treat guests like this. Absolutely bonkers way to treat people.\n",

We didn&#39;t bring a dog, but it was nice to know it was dog friendly.\n",

      "Positive: Beyond beautiful place , the room was clean and really well designed . Everyone of the staff members was wonderful and welcoming. If you’ve never been to new hope this place is right in the heart of the town and the river view was amazing. We travel often and can confidently say that this was one of the most pleasant stays we have had from the professionalism of the staff to the building its self . The staff went above and beyond to make us feel at home . They are incredibly dog friendly if you are bringing along a pet offering complimentary dog beds and comforts. We travel with a service animal and have had many poor encounters at the higher end places due to the pet policies , this place was an exception. The staff went as far as getting us a large box of chocolates from a local chocolatier and writing a hand written anniversary card. I could go on raving on our experience here but simply put it’s a must . They are attached to an excellent eatery The Stella and along side many other local attractions and eateries. Upon checking in we also received a card that gives you a discount to a local food and goods market. Value here for what you get exceeds so you have any doubts , know from picky travelers this place kicks a**! Treat yourself check them out . Thank you Ghost Light Inn for doing things the way they should be done.\n",

      "Positive: Great location. Dog friendly.Very peaceful and an escape from city life for a few days. Situated in Bodinnick, opposite Fowey. A ferry provides regular trips to Fowey-only takes a few minutes to get across.   Car parking is a few metres from the Inn in a secluded area.   Hall Walk is nearby. A pleasant 3 mile walk to Polruan. From Polruan there is a foot ferry that takes you to Fowey.   Exceptionally friendly staff. Pete, Paul and the rest of the team were extremely accommodating. Meeting Archie the Newfoundland (favourite dog breed...Shh don&#39;t tell my English Springer Spaniel) was definitely the highlight of our stay.  Room was very comfortable and nicely decorated. Tea&#47;coffee facilities were provided as well as toiletries. The hot tub on top deck as well as the balcony provided lovely views of Fowey and the Eastuary.   Had breakfast and our evening meal everyday throughout our stay and it was faultless. There&#39;s a micro distillery on site. I tried the blueberry gin with a dash of lemonade and it was delicious. I recommend it to those who don&#39;t normally drink gin, like myself.  Cannot wait to return. Thank you!  Please put hooks behind the bathroom door to hang towels after use.\n",

The second was the shower, and this is purely thinking of future guests that maybe a bit unsteady on their feet.

      "Negative: Housekeeping staff standing outside our room talking very loudly on her phone for 15 min before 9AM on a holiday. It was disruptive.   Only one functional elevator, we had to take the stairs from 1st-6th floor every time. Bottom of the stairs is littered with junk and smells bad.  Semi-permanent residents crowding every entrance and exit of the hotel, making it very difficult for guests to walk through. Their children scream, clap and run at our dog when we are entering and leaving the hotel and we had to tell them on multiple occasions to not harass the animal. Their parents are either nowhere is sight or do not say anything.  It has made our stay quite stressful, especially when forced to go through the narrow stairs with these screaming children blocking the path and trying to touch the dog.   We would have appreciated a warning prior to booking that the hotel is now housing permanent guests, and hope that the hotel will warn them and the children not to frighten any future dogs staying with you.\n",

I did place three trigger objects and the one on the chair went off 3 times while I was trying to get to sleep.   Lovely friendly staff.  Room was really nice, very clean and welcoming. Small but perfectly put together.   When asked about my stay by the manager, my face must have given me away and she encouraged me to be honest so they can fix any issues. When I told her about the issues in the other section she was very apologetic and lovely about the constructive criticism.   All issues could easily be fixed so I would stay there again because I do like the place and the staff. It&#39;s also dog friendly which is a plus. I did tell her that as well.\n",
      "Negative: The window had been left open so the room was freezing. The inner window slides shut but the outer original window is a sash window and I couldn&#39;t close it. I could feel a draft and could hear traffic noise from the main road all night.   I did turn the radiator on but it turned itself off (probably a timer) and was cold when I got up. The room had warmed up a bit and I finally nodded off but woke up very early and the room was quite cold again.  The bed needs a new mattress. I could feel metal springs. Not comfortable.   I hardly slept because of issues above. 5 hours of broken sleep, but to be fair I never sleep well in hotels.  Shower was lukewarm on the hottest setting.\n",

The beds are extremely comfortable and the neighbourhood is very quiet, which made for a very welcomed good nights&#39; sleep, after a long walk.

I&#39;m pretty certain this is illegal and hope Booking gets back to me on this. I am NOT talking about the pet charge.   We were misled by Booking.com   Our microwave touchpad did nothing, so we went unable to reheat anything or make hot drinks for the weekend.   Overall it was an okay stay, but only because we didn&#39;t really need the microwave.   They were very chaste with towels and wouldn&#39;t give us 4.  We also never got maid service once during our 3 night stay.  These minor issues aren&#39;t a deal breaker at a cheap place,  but we did this place SPECIFICALLY because it was listed as 600 or 602sqft.  Great casino&#47;diner in the parking lot!

The staff were incredibly friendly, caring and professional, starting our stay with Bianca, who warmly welcomed us and explained us everything with detail and gave us great ideas for our stay. The hotel&#39;s cleanliness was impeccable, and its strategical location - 5 min walking to the next beach - made exploring the area a breeze. Fabio and the whole team made our experience memorable with a fun and engaging Canarian wine tasting. We also joined other fun activities organised every evening at the hotel. The rooftop pool and bar were definite highlights, offering stunning sunset views and the perfect atmosphere with the most delicious cocktails. We are already looking forward to returning (next time with our dog, as it is not only an ecofriendly but also a dog friendly hotel) and highly recommend this hotel to others seeking a wonderful experience in Callao Salvaje or Tenerife in general.\n",

      "Positive: As we were going to the P&amp;J for an event, this seemed the obvious choice. Hadn&#39;t been there before. There is parking on site at £5 a day - excellent value! The staff were super friendly and dog friendly! The rooms were a decent size, beds very comfortable, the shower absolutely amazing and everything was spotlessly clean. We weren&#39;t interested in going into the city for food - the bar menu provides various burgers (including veg), pizzas, nachos, a couple of standard go to desserts and the alcohol is reasonably priced (about the same as you would expect in the city if not slightly cheaper). Absolutely going back if I have to do an event at the P&amp;J as it is within staggering distance of the hotel.\n",

The hospitality tray didn&#39;t appear to have been topped up from the previous occupants (3 coffees, 3 sugars, 4 tea - 2 normal, 2 camomile - 4 small UHT milk, no biscuits), no room folder or locality guide but 2 bibles (Gideon and mormon), bizarre.\n",

      "Positive: The rooms are very large. The inner ground level rooms within the pool area have a  secondary door which is fantastic. I can step outside and enjoy the weather and see the pool. I find myself visiting with many of the guests who are doing the same thing and enjoying there patio area too. The hot tub is a pool of its own. It&#39;s huge.  It&#39;s always up and running. There is a laundry room that&#39;s never closed. The odds of one or both washers being available for use are very high. There is a change machine at the front desk if your looking for quarters.  But the odds of the machine having quarters available is almost none.  I keep it simple and stop by a car wash on my way to the hotel and exchange my bills there.  NoTE- make sure the machine gives quarters not TOKENS. lol.  Otherwise you&#39;ll be in a mess.  Next the hotel accepts dogs. Make sure you do it the rite way.  Don&#39;t sneak your dog in.  Doesn&#39;t work here.  The dog area isn&#39;t much of a dog friendly area.  But they accept bigger dogs and is you have a bigger dog you understand this is HUGE. Being able to take my dog out to do his business  anytime I need to and not have any issues is priceless!! Plus the hotel has a wall of Oleanders that lines the entire place.  It&#39;s green and quite pretty. My dogs love it.  The staff is great.  Haven&#39;t had one problem of any kind.  Great place\n",

      "Negative: We booked one of the executive rooms , as there are only the two and one other that allow dogs, they have wooden floors, and as expected we paid extra for the room. However when I came to settle I was asked for an extra £30 per night for the dog. It was stated in their info that there would be a £30 per night fee, but having booked a dog friendly room, it was not entirely clear that the £30 was on top. I guess some people have smelly dogs that dribble and moult and mess up the place, and I could understand a daily charge if it had to be cleaned daily, but we had our own dog blankets and towels, and the room was left no dirtier than if we had no dog with us. In fact my partner left more hair than the dog, but I suppose I should be grateful the hotel did not ask for extra to clean up her hair.  I feel the hotel are just making extra money out of dog owners, perhaps they should reserve the right to charge extra if it is clear a dog has been messy, but an indiscriminate £30 for each night, rather than a one off cleaning fee is very moneygrabbing, especially as we has already paid extra to have a room with a wooden floor. When I spoke to the receptionist on checking out, she explained some people turn up without reading their rules on dogs, I got the impression rather than turn them away, they let the dog use their room, in which case £30 a night is fully justified, but having booked a dog friendly room and been careful to keep the dog off soft furnishings, I feel I should not have been as considerate, and as the hotel was charging me I should have let the dog run free and not bother even cleaning it when it came in.\n",

We received a wonderful room on the first floor, with a direct view to the Castle of Conwy. The camera was quite large, spacious, with a comfortable double bed, decorated quite chic, in English style. The old radio modified into a very digital modern tool has been quite an asset. We loved the furniture, the lights and the bath that was extremely clean and fully uploaded with many cosmetics provided by partners of the Castle Hotel. The breakfast is amazing, you can select multiple options from a particular list, and we must say that the Full Welsh Breakfast and the selection of Eggs were on top of our preferences. Good coffee for two committed people with cofeine, but mostly a very pretty salon, with a fireplace, where during evenings we used to dine and have a drink. Good selection of beers, tasty fish and chips! The hotel is dog friendly, so we had many fluffy little ones to play with from neighbors. The hotel has some nice pubs and restaurants around and is situated in the heart of Conwy.  We went right after Christmas and the decorations were lovely. To put all briefly, is a very pretty hotel, with good taste, great food, lovely view and an accurate English spirit.   Conwy is very intimate, historical, kind, even during winters, and the staff of the hotel is very implicated, receptive, and professional. So, if you go in North Wales add Conwy Castle Hotel on your list!\n",

Wake up to see wallabies just outside the room, hand feed wild birds who are too impatient to wait for the feeder to be filled and make friends with the horses.

We pointed out a glass had been broken outside, staff acted immediately to clear it up. We forgot to pay for one meal, and it wasnt mentioned when we checked out. Luckily we remained around a while, and the landlord politely approached us and checked if that was indeed the case, and we were able to put it right without feeling (too) bad! Arnside is a good place to stay with lots of walks for our dogs, the Fighting Cocks is well located and a good place to stay in Arnside, for location, dog-friendly facilities, and good customer service.\n",

Genuinely dog friendly accommodation which is always welcome as you can relax.   Good remote location , lots of parking , close enough to road network.   The dark haired lady who was front of house on arrival was fabulous so worth a note. Organised an early check in for us as the dogs needed shade in the heat, and was super informative, friendly and helpful. I travel a lot and I think staff really can make a huge difference to the stay. This lady is an asset to the hotel.   Menus for restaurant ( evening meal) and breakfast were fabulous and food lovely 👍  Lovely local friendly community who made me feel welcome.\n",
      "Negative: This is not a criticism but more of a personal preference. The room we were allocated was right above the outdoor bar &#47; restaurant. The noise of the dance music and groups of people drinking directly below us did not cease until after midnight. It was too hot to close the window so this wasn’t ideal as I had an early start. I think had I known in advance  I would have requested &#47; booked one of the rooms at the back of the hotel for a quieter evening.   I don’t want this note to distract from how lovely the hotel is , as it’s a fab place, but an important point nonetheless , it was also a Friday evening so probably busier.\n",

If you&#39;re into photography the village will keep you busy for hours. A whole network of footpaths in all directions from the inn, ideal for dog walking. About a 15 minute walk into Settle centre. The inn itself is very dog friendly, we had our two with us and they were made very welcome by Marley, the resident dog and several other visitors in the bar. (If you don&#39;t like dogs then beware, you are likely to encounter several here). All staff very friendly and welcoming. Clearly a thriving local pub, we stayed for two nights and ate in the bar each night - two excellent meals. Breakfasts also very good, made fresh to order from the previous night. Room very comfortable and obviously newly furnished. Altogether a great vibe and a thoroughly enjoyable weekend.\n",

Every day our room key would stop working and we would have to get new ones- super inconvenient. The girls in the front were not very nice. Everyday we had to ask for new towels and coffee. They would only give 2 coffee packs per day. We are staying 5 days- why not stock us up? Everything was very skimpy and cheap. It says “dog friendly” and even has a dog on the hotel sign, but the only grass area on the property has about 10 signs saying no dogs! Instead you have to take your dog to a back dark and dirty lot.  Overall, our trip to Tahoe was beautiful! We tried to spend minimal time in our room. We will not stay at 3 Peaks again.\n",

So this time around when visiting Atlanta we decided to stay five nights at Le Meridien.  Unfortunately it did not live up to our expectations.  Our assigned room was at the end of the corridor and had bright light streaming into the room at night, plus an uncomfortable bed. We decided to move the following day.  The new  room was better, but still showed signs of wear. We asked for our room to be serviced the last day we were there, and it never was. So we had to get fresh towels, coffee and water ourselves. Charging $6 for coffee in the lobby borders on offensive. The one main plus is that this is a dog friendly hotel next to a nice office park with a lake where you can walk your furry companion.

Hotel has such beautiful grounds!   Our room was absolutely stunning it was suites with huge private pool and deck we didn’t even bother their famous rooftop pool! Well we went to see and it’s beautiful but we loved our suite so much.   One last and the most important thing was that we have two small dog with us and it was the most welcoming feeling that every staff &amp; guests gave us we were so happy about that.

      "Positive: The estate itself is beautiful, set in the countryside. The cottage is beautifully set out and has everything you need. we had the middle cottage which had two bedrooms. one with a double bed and the other with two single beds. it has a bathroom, with shower and bath and has a downstairs toilet. The cottages all have access to the courtyard to the front and has back doors in which have two hot tubes, sharing two people in each. the courtyard has a games room, great for children and adults who like to play games. they have plenty of parking and dog friendly. Martin who looks after the estate was very attentive and friendly.\n",

Took me ages to find it, as trees are hiding all the signage.&amp; hotel   Needs a bit of small furnishings renewals that are grubby  ( dirty grubby side table lamp shade, tile grouting looked dirty. Needed a refresh )  Curtains need to open both ways. As when a window is open. Every one can see in behind the net  As guests in adjoining rooms have no choice but to walk past window to get out.   Small touches could make this place lovely.  But it was a comfy room.  I would stay again, just think the owners need to be aware of these little things.   Got locked out my room, as I shut the door without my key tab. ( not a proper key )  Reception sorted it tho and let me back in. Luckily it was before reception shut. As I didn&#39;t have my phone on me to call the emergency number.\n",

However once I pressed the non refundable book button I found out I had to upgrade to a dog friendly room for another £20. Not impressed. The dog conditions need to be explained fully in the blurb. It&#39;s £165 per night with a dog, which I do not consider value for money, and would have cancelled the booking had I not been cornered into spending a non refundable £145 already. When we came to settle our bill we were presented with a bill for somebody else&#39;s evening meal. This was dealt with, apologies made, however adding somebody else&#39;s meal to my bill was sloppy and lazy.

      "Negative: The doors into the bedrooms are not soundproofed, and this means that you can hear everything going on in the corridor. Not an issue unless other guests are leaving at 6.30am and holding a conversation without any regard for other guests.   The other point is that the hotel doesn&#39;t allow you to take your dogs into the bar&#47;restaurant area when having breakfast . There is a coffee table that sits in the entrance, next to the reception desk and the thoroughfare from the bedrooms to the lobby area. This is the only space you can sit as a dog owner! Whilst I appreciate not all guests want to eat with dogs nearby, there was an area leading into the restaurant that would have been suitable for dog owners. Not sure what the hotel would have offered us if there had been someone else sitting at the one and only dog friendly table! We really did feel like the poor relations ( even though we paid more for having a dog). There is a public bar that you can get to from outside but breakfasts aren&#39;t served there and the menu for evening meals is basic and very much reduced compared to the hotel&#39;s..  I wouldn&#39;t really recommend this hotel if you have a dog and want to eat a decent meal as they aren&#39;t really dog friendly other than letting you take your dog into your room. That&#39;s fine but they need to specify this as I imagine most guests would want to eat at the hotel.\n",

The children enjoyed the pool area, despite it being very busy, as one would expect in the last week of August.  The site is close to a nice beach and walk along the cliffs&#47;coast, which we enjoyed. The beach isn&#39;t dog friendly, which we knew and agree with for young children in summer, although we saw people dog walking early morning and late evening.  We drove 15-20 mins to Les Minimes to park and walk into La Rochelle. Being able to do this was another reason for choosing a site on this side of La Rochelle.\n",

There is green around the edges that should be cleaned off. People have written their names into it, suggesting it has been there for a while.  There is a knack to the door, which had to be explained to us. This took some time to work out (obviously we tried for ages rather than rush to reception) and was a bit annoying. However, one of the team did come to help.  On the chalet side of the park, which is the same side as reception, the chalets are close to each other, to the extent that after opposing chalets each park their car other people struggle to drive past.   You clean the chalet yourself and we felt that some of the sand and dust on the floor was not from our stay. (It is hard to know just how clean sites require mobilhomes to be. I clean the toilets and wipe everything down, among other things, no idea if staff also clean the chalets or if the next person comes straight in.)  Notwithstanding the above, this is a good value location for a visit to La Rochelle and having a beach very close by.\n",

The beds are comfortable and the hotel is equipped with everything you need and the staff cannot do enough for you. We had the luxury of staying whilst quiet so it felt almost as if we had the house to ourselves. We staying in a lake view room, room two. We sat in the back room with an open fire for most of the evening after a short night walk around the garden. The night sky is fantastic. It&#39;s also worth getting up a little earlier to walk down to the water to watch the sunrise. The water was so still and the sky was beautiful. We hoped to see the baby deer but better luck next time, as we will definitely be back for another stay. This place is dog friendly so we will return with our bichon frise.

Carpets seemed new everywhere and decor not tired at all. Attractive bar area. Wifi very strong. Good sized TV opposite the bed.

Parking anywhere central is so extortionate that after 24 hours even the hotel&#39;s £23 a day charge seemed a bargain. Wasn&#39;t easy but we eventually secured a small space for our small car on the hotel lot. Just don&#39;t bring a car to Brighton as there are no other cheap options, even taking account of free overnight parking on the front.

You’ll need a car to reach it but the place is next to the ring road so that’s not problematic.\n",

They have a stretch of grass that my dog could frolic in and he made a new friend in doing so.  The breakfast is amazing and sets you up for the day.  There was a fridge in our room which was really good as I drink a lot of water and prefer it ice cold.\n",

We had to sit in the reception area to have a drink and leave our well behaved dog in the room in the evenings .

Steve and Sonja are really nice, friendly and inviting hosts. They gave good tips for walking and Steve made a reservation for us in a good and dog friendly restaurant. That was really nice. The Nest Glamping Pod is small but cosy. The first evening it rained so we stayed inside but that was nice, warm and cosy. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom was quite large and clean. If you like tiny housing this is a perfect place. We made a nice walk to the monument uphill from where you have an stunning view. It was also a wonderful place for our Golden Retriever. He could be off the lead all the time. The description Steve sent us about how to drive to the property was very clear and helpful\n",

They have a beautifully decorated restaurant and a beer garden which is iluminated by the sun. But don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t get sunburned, since the seating area is protected by ombrelones. We stayed there for 2 nights and we recommed eating at the restaurant, which serves delicious authentic German food. It&#39;s also worth having breakfast there. The bread is crunchy and kept warm as if it had just come out of the oven. The scramble eggs is prepared on the spot.   The room is comfortable and have good blinds which allows you to sleep in late. The area is quiet and you can hear birds singing.   They have limited parking space so you have to book that in advance. They charge 20 euros per day. There is also public parking next to it. I used the P13 which costs around 20 euros per day. It&#39;s very close and practical.  We were traveling with our bernese mountain dog and I must say that this is truly a dog friendly place. However, if you have a large dog (50 kg), ask for a room on the ground floor. The stairs were a little slippery for the dog to climb but nothing that we couldn&#39;t manage.\n",

      "Negative: Our main problem was the bed, it was a standard double not a queen, so quite neat for us, but the worst bit for me was the mattress was far too soft. Probably not a drama for some but it meant we had to leave after one night as couldn’t face another night on it.  Other negatives were the Wi-Fi was pretty much non existent and tv channels were very limited. Also the menu in the main restaurant was different to online, I know that the menu online is a sample, but really, how many minutes would it take for someone to update the website? Despite that we did thoroughly enjoy the food.\n",

The room was five star quality - the finishing a, the bed, the linen, the interior design… AMAZING! We had lots of space too.  3. Relative to the quality of room &amp; service - it’s an absolute steal! If Mandy charged double, I’d still come back  4. It’s really hard to find a place that is dog friendly, let alone somewhere as nice as this!

      "Positive: We wanted to do something different, rather than just spend another night in another hotel.  So the prospect of staying on a yacht in a marina certainly fitted the bill.    The onsite team were fantastic and when a group on a neighbouring boat forgot to quieten down at 10 pm, they were on the ball and reminded them of the rules.  Brilliant service.  We did wonder what we&#39;d be doing for food but needn&#39;t have worried.  There are plenty of dog friendly bars to enjoy and a convenience store to get some supplies.      WE WILL BE BACK AND FOR LONGER NEXT TIME, AND MAYBE ON A BIGGER YACHT IF THERE IS ONE.\n",

We had several suitcases as this was an overnight stop before heading off for part 1 of our break - and it worked.\n",

The breakfast was very good for a continental breakfast with hot and cold cereals, yogurts, juices, coffee and tea, breads and jam for toast, fruit cups and real dishes and cutlery. Breakfast room was clean and bright. Pool out in the back and a St. Hubert BBQ restaurant within the hotel as well. Dog friendly, too!! Lots of parking available.\n",

      "Negative: The place just felt really empty and lacking in atmosphere. A skeleton staff at the height of the season. Perhaps the impact of Brexit&#47;Covid and holiday homes stealing the heart from the town. There were some cleanliness issues too - bin not emptied in the ensuite, stains on the cloth under the hospitality tray and stains on the carpet. Water in the tap in the ensuite was just a trickle but I think there were issues with water in the area. Overall I got the impression that staffing was the real issue with this hotel and I do understand how hard it must be to get staff. Despite the issues, I think it was fairly priced.\n",

Our room was dog friendly but there is still no excuse … it is about £10 for a new shower curtain and a lick of paint takes a few hours.

The burger wasn&#39;t homemade which my husband expected for the venue, good enough size but plain, with no taste at all.  Breakfast - the fried egg was undercooked, and the potato Scone and haggis&#47;black pudding were dripping in oil but could tell the product quality was there.  On the morning of check out, we were handed a dog pack with a drying towel, dog treats etc as they forgot to pass this to us at check-in.

Having a dog friendly accommodation where the dogs could sleep in their crates inside with us was the deciding reason for going to the event. The staff was friendly, and unit was clean and tidy, and the heater was fantastic. Only a short walk into town to restaurants and supermarket. We all slept really well. We will definitely be booking again when the next agility event is in town.\n",

      "Negative: We stayed for six nights and there was no room cleaning or bin changing within that time. We asked at reception whether our floor could be vacuumed, and we were told that it wasn&#39;t an option that we had selected whilst booking (there was no such option). We also finished one of the little complementary shower gels after three days and I asked for another, to which I was told that it was only a welcome gesture. On booking.com, it definitely states that there are free toiletries.  I would completely understand not giving toiletries away as it can be wasteful, but I think for six nights that a second mini bottle is justified.  I would also understand not cleaning the room constantly during a guest&#39;s stay, but I think when the room has a kitchenette, a bin change and a vacuum would be nice.  Alternatively, the room could supply a long handled broom and a new bin bag for us to clean up a bit.\n",

The owner, Si goes out of his way to welcome his guests and it is clear from the outset that his guests are his highest priority. Whilst we have the privacy to enjoy the apartment we know that he is available at any time he might be needed. He is keen to ensure his guests enjoy their stay and has texted to ask if there is anything he can do.

For me it felt claustrophobic and the tiny window which looked out onto a small wall felt to me quite grim . The choice of decor was pleasant and furnishings etc were adequate just far too small and dark for me We mentioned the room to the receptionist afterthe first night, and she was very helpful and able to move us into a much nicer room with more space and natural light and air. The shower was very small with a plastic curtain and leaked water onto the floor which made it hazardous. I would not have been happy to stay in the first room there for the 6 nights that we booked. Also on the last night it was a Christmas party time which was very loud and intrusive until around 11 30.  Ear plugs were provided which was a nice touch really. Having said all this I will still return to The Queens .\n",

Check In wasn’t great - chose pre payment option when I booked in March, money was never deducted from my account and I had to pay upon arrival. Not a huge deal, but when I booked I also requested a ground level room with a walkout since we’d have our dog with us. I received an email from booking saying my special request was approved. On arrival we were informed that the hotel doesn’t take special requests and ground level rooms with exterior entry can only be requested day of check-in if you call. Breakfast was mediocre but chaotic; not nearly enough space where breakfast is served for the amount of rooms in this hotel. 3-4 tables available and everything is crammed on one section of counter.\n",

However after researching this property, we had envisioned sitting in adirondack chairs around the fire pit with our dog, meeting other people, eating from the food truck and maybe listening to live music. What happened was that our dog was not allowed in those areas and we had to sit in an area shared with kids playing ping pong, no  live music and the Trans Fat food truck was counter to the &quot;healthy&quot; vibe the property had.( the dumplings were delicious , but the majority of the menu was deep fried) For whatever reason,  we had mistakenly thought that the area by the John Wayne mural was a dog play area.\n",

Dinner was delicious and great value for money. Next mornings selection for continental breakfast was amazing, full size pastries, fresh melon, cheese and meats. As well as the cooked options. We asked for our bacon and sausage baps to take away, which they kindly wrapped up for us. We had to make a couple trips out, they let us leave one car there and come back and use the garden&#47;bar area as a base to work between visits. Couldn&#39;t have asked for a nicer place or team.

Small increase, but nevertheless no reason for not simply charging the daily promised rate. The kitchen was closed one day during our stay, and the sign offered a free continental breakfast for all guests. That was very nice. But, we had paid for a hot breakfast and requesting a credit be given was not a very customer friendly experience. Still have not received the credit and the manager seemed annoyed that we had asked for it. Very bad final impression of what was an enjoyable visit.

It was October, and raining, but the room and the hotel, were lovely and warm. There was a separate sitting room with tv and spacious bathroom with bath and separate shower. The main restaurant was not open  while we were there, but we dined in a lovely little bistro in the grounds, and had really excellent food, especially the lamb.

      "Positive: You get what you pay for. It’s very dated and in need of attention, but for the price it’s what you would expect. Rather disappointing that it’s dog friendly yet the dog cannot go in the bar&#47;restaurant, but the staff bring you what you need so not too big of an issue I guess. Could be in busier months though as I was travelling on my own and couldn’t get my breakfast as had my dog, but the lady kindly brought it to me - can’t see them doing that when very busy though. On that note, the staff are very helpful&#47;friendly and overall very accommodating. Breakfast was ok too (my dog enjoyed it very much - haha). Can’t really complain for £45 when you get a large double room with sea view including breakfast. Would return again for a budget night away.\n",

      "Negative: The restaurant was very understaffed and not particularly friendly - a poor reflection on the rest of the hotel. It had very strange&#47;strict opening times, was not dog-friendly (unlike the rest of the hotel- please consider making a dog-friendly section available in the future like many other restaurants) and they weren’t happy about us eating outside (even though there were tables and chairs there) - they basically refused to provide table service outside at all and even for the self service buffet breakfast weren’t happy about us taking food outside (though they didn’t stop us). Also poor communication between reception&#47;front of house and the restaurant staff - particularly around opening times. The restaurant staff seemed very overworked, unhappy and understaffed - definitely an area for improvement.\n",

The apartment is beautifully renovated, with lots of windows and super bright and warm and cosy )important in mid November!). I loved the bright open plan kitchen&#47;living room space. It’s over the owner’s pub. I did ask if the pub (his pub) was dog friendly, and he said he was, but his customers might not be. I was unclear as to if it was or was not.

The staff at Rivertide is also super friendly and quick to offer help when needed. I really appreciated how dog friendly the Rivertide is, with complimentary dog towels + treats at the front entrance and folks always saying hello and being excited to see a dog around. The cute lil bar inside hosts a good happy hour with $4 beers. Quiet time (starting at 9pm) was really well observed and we appreciated it- it was very quiet overnight.\n",
      "Negative: The amenities are nice but not quite &#39;all the way there&#39; considering the (slightly) higher cost of the Rivertide. The breakfast is really simple with nothing hot, cooked or fresh, the jet tub in our room was pretty temperamental (hard to turn on + off and after we used it the tub jets would randomly turn on), and the conditioner dispenser was broken&#47;had nothing inside of it. Pretty minor stuff and overall our stay was nice, but would have felt more of a value if the amenities mirrored the higher nightly rate of this property.\n",

He was knowledgable and happy to share information about the area while also allowing us the space to enjoy our meal &amp; stay. They are super dog friendly and there is always a treat for a good boy. The room was so comfortable, bedding was super soft and cool which was well appreciated in July. It was easy to find, easy to communicate any changes to our arrangements, ample parking and a really tasty meal.\n",
      "Negative: As there was no mirror in the bedroom, let alone a floor length one, I would have then appreciated the bathroom mirror being mist-free so getting make up on after showers wasn’t the easiest task. The floor was creaky as expected from such a lovely old building and while this didn’t bother us and we didn’t hear any neighbours, I cannot say the same for a light sleeper or anyone staying below us. I would also recommend they update their menus online, cocktail prices have gone up by 50% and food menu has changed drastically.\n",

We will definitely stay again too.    Also very close to beautiful Bamburgh beach - lovely for dog walk 😊\n",

Nice quiet area away from the hussle and bussle of Seattle traffic. parking lot seemed full but didn&#39;t hear a peep from people walking outside of room- woke up to birds chirping. Easy check in&#47;out and staff was very welcoming. Nice clean room, Beds a little on the firmer side but had no issues. Grocery stores located near by, plus the beach was like 10 mins away. Good place will definitely stay again. Oh! We have 2 larger dogs at home but didn&#39;t have them on this trip but the facility is dog friendly!

      "Positive: I have been in this Hotel some times, we enjoyed our rest here. This time too, the room was big enough, there was enough space for the dogs and for ourselves. The bed was very comfortable, soft &amp; clean, we enjoyed a good night&#39;s sleep.  We got a room in a very good locatio of hotel, on the first floor very close to the SPA and near the exit to the courtyard, very comfortable stay with dogs.  I can also praise the fact that the refrigerator worked in normal cool mode this time, unfortunately in most hotels the refrigerator only serves a decorative function and does not cool food. It worked very well. Air-conditioning also was worked very well.  We had already enjoyed the SPA area, we knew about its amenities.  The location of Hotel is great, especially for those who want to enjoy a vacation by the sea, but the city is also very close, you can walk comfortably. Breakfast was very good and a lot by choice to every taste!  Attitude to dogs are very okay in this Hotel. Dog friendly, but for extra money of course.\n",
      "Negative: This time, as we have been here several times already, we got the impression that the hotel needed a cosmetic improvement, a more modernized style. Rooms are very simple by style &amp; design.   As this is a 4-star hotel, we were a little disappointed that there was no water left on the table for the guests, which is usually everywhere in hotels. And there were no hotel slippers, only robes. We received hotel slippers at the reception upon request.   As I have written before, the hotel has many rules and fees for the stay of dogs, but nothing is provided for dogs. No bowl, no bags, no any welcome greeting for them.   Overall, we enjoyed the experience in this Hotel, as always. We wish this Hotel become a bit more modern and keep the lever of 4-stars Hotel. Think about small details, like water for guests, pet bowl, maybe some shampoos in barhroom &amp; etc.\n",

She fixed everything for us!\n",
      "Negative: It felt understaffed. The receptionist was also running the bar and taking guests to their rooms in the golf buggy which (although not life changing!) caused some delays in service. Our on line booking for the restaurant somehow got translated as a booking for the snack bar (@ 8pm at night!) and was only discovered upon check in at 6.30pm. Fortunately it could be amended. The breakfast room was pretty much unstaffed so when I would have usually ordered a second coffee at 10am (it closes at 10.30am) there was nobody left in the kitchen. The cleaner who arrived in a golf buggy at 12.40 to clean the room upstairs skidded to a halt on the gravel next to my husbands car just as he was reversing it in to load our luggage, jumped out, glared at us and started slamming around the place (clearly in a very bad mood)!

      "Negative: Since they are so dog friendly it would be very helpful for them to have a dog relief area on the property. The surrounding neighborhood is ok but not great and the dog walking options were mediocre.  Our room faced Wilshire Blvd. If I stayed here again I would request a room on the north side to reduce the traffic noise. I felt the additional overnight parking charge of $50 per day was too high but it&#39;s essential given the limited street parking and safety.\n",

Everything from the designated car space, to being dog friendly, to being located in a tranquil and isolated street (so despite being in the heart of Paris, the hotel itself is like a sanctuary from the bustle). The lobby and lounge areas were also so peaceful with beautiful piano music always welcoming you back to the hotel. Moadh from the front desk added tremendously to our overall experience of the hotel as he was always joyful and smiling, attentive, friendly and greeting us whenever we entered the hotel or left (you can tell he genuinely enjoys making guests feel welcome and valued) and this sort of client service is exactly what elevates a hotel experience to the next level for a guest. The room itself was perfect for us and being able to open the windows out on the lovely inner courtyard&#47;garden outlook made our room feel more like a little studio apartment than merely a hotel room. I will absolutely stay here anytime I ever wish to return to Paris. We have exceptional memories of our hotel stay.

The beds were comfortable for those who prefer stiff matraces (like me). This place is a good starting point for many hikes (like Mostnica canyon, Vogar, Vogel, ...). In the village there are two shops and several opportunities to eat. Breakfasts can be served outside with a lake view. Apartmaji Triglav itself has a high ranking restaurant with several course menus (33-50 euros for 3 to 5 courses, which is on the more expensive side).

The facilities were more than adequate with lovely furnishings. The breakfast was second to none, fresh, &amp; delicious. Lottie the dog loved her Cumberland sausage &amp; was able to eat with us.

The staff were extremely friendly &amp; helpful. The location was fabulous as it was centred in the square &amp; ideal for the pubs, shops &amp; lovely walks. The is no parking, only drop off point outside, however the car park is a short distance away, £8 to park all day &amp; free after 6pm until 9am. The only downside was the TV wasn’t working &amp; we couldn’t get normal channels, only YouTube. I would definitely recommend a stay at this little hidden gem as you won’t be disappointed.

On sitting down at the table there was a bucket and mop with dirty water and detergent in left next to the table and a hoover left out too Nobody moved the bucket or hoover while we ate so my husband did it !!

Don’t know much about smart tvs so that could well be normal…  In the kitchen lots of cupboards with a few utilities in could possibly be consolidated to give a bit of a more convenient cupboard space for food items?

Mouldy sealant inside the shower that could do with replacing. Taps were difficult to turn off. The quarters were a little difficult to find. The address leads you to a car park at the main entrance, not to the accommodation. Had to look on the map in the car park to find where we were going. There are signs on the entrance but maybe these aren&#39;t quite obvious enough. There is absolutely no phone signal. Maybe a positive! There is free public WiFi if you choose to trust it.

Sky sports on big screens around the pub were good for watching the formula one and the football.\n",

I didn&#39;t complain because the place was really busy and I feel like other people around were really enjoying their food so we just got a little unlucky with when we ordered. We did get told that we wouldn&#39;t have to book because they wouldn&#39;t be busy that night, so I think they got caught out by a rush.  The only other thing that annoyed me is that the shower gel, shampoo and hand wash all seemed to be the same blue chemical, it all seemed to do the same thing and it wasn&#39;t very good for my luscious locks....\n",

Despite a large open space around the pool, dog was allowed to walk through to access beach but not stop ???  Hotel had large area around pool bar with numerous outside tables, dog not allowed.  Hotel provided what looked like excellent breakfast, dinner service, again despite outside tables dog not allowed.

Went back to queue in line at the restaurant to pay for meal time drinks. Only to find to our delight drinks where on the house.     Hallway carpets looked rotten. Although  Noticed a large pile of new carpets outside, For refreshment and fitting later.   Maybe a wee bit of a to dog friendly hotel. Feel bad for the house keeping staff cleaning up after dog owners.\n",

Also a really love park to walk around 1 minute away across the main road. Room had not been updated since it was a premier inn, but apart from lack of convenient sockets (not a single one near the bed!) it was well equipped. Super comfy beds. Tea&#47;Coffee provided, shower was good. We paid for breakfast and it was good value and freshly cooked. Really important to remember you get what you pay for with this. It was a good budget option.\n",
      "Negative: Honestly just niggles, but staff were very young and possibly new. Nobody there to check us in, eventually we worked out we had to go into the pub where there was a queue of disgruntled people waiting as it was prime check in time.  Check in was fine but we weren&#39;t provided with any information such as Wifi password (which also was nowhere in the room, eventually found a slip of paper that another guest had left and it worked!)  My main concern as has already been noted here, is that a fire door to the outside was kept wide open to the public for the whole duration of our stay (Including during the night) . I think this is possibly illegal from fire safety regs, but mainly for security I felt it was not great that anybody could just walk in and out of the rear of the hotel directly to the bedrooms.\n",

Evelyn was a lovely host, so welcoming and friendly and the breakfast was delicious. Also free parking at the back and dog friendly, Evelyn also allowed our dog into the breakfast room as he’s so small which was great as he’s very anxious when left alone. Will definitely stay at Dunvegan on our next trip to Windermere\n",

The receptionist was friendly and helpful.  I found it a bit odd that the microwave and two plate hotplate were outside by the room doors. The decor was a little dated, but this is just a matter of personal taste. However,  there are renovations of the motel going on. It was great that the motel is dog friendly.

Don’t get me wrong the room was quite small and basic, although for the price we paid I am not grumbling. It was clean and we had a bed to sleep in. Warm welcome at the reception and it is dog friendly too so there was lots of different characters walking round the hotel.\n",

      "Positive: Found this after looking for a dog friendly pub with accommodation so we could visit Mullion and the surrounding area for my wife’s birthday . Booked in for one night B&amp;B with our two Red Setters. Room perfectly adequate for our stay. The host and pub itself was really friendly and welcoming. Great atmosphere. Had an evening meal there. Both of us chose the salt and pepper squid to start, followed by the king prawn linguine and treacle tart. Really good meal. Hearty full English breakfast the next day. No complaints from us. Would use again\n",
      "Negative: As the pub is advertised as dog friendly it would have been useful to have some details of dog walks in the area especially when you first arrive after a long journey and there is no beach in mullion cove to exercise them. A bit of wear and tear on the hallway and stairs leading to the rooms but nothing too drastic\n",

They even brought in a cooked coke sausage for Ruby my lab at breakfast. She was allowed to go anywhere except the restaurant (which is acceptable), so sitting in the lounge having her by my side was just lovely. Some other dog friendly hotels in the lakes put you in dingy rooms with no access to the gardens, at The Leeming I was in a gorgeous big room with double doors to the terrace which opened up to the garden - perfect for taking the dog out at night time and early in the morning. Plenty of bins around - very useful when you’re a dog owner.  the grounds were a joy to walk around and the little chairs dotted around and by the lake were just beautiful. Perfectly located to local walks and villages. My new found place. I can’t wait to be back.\n",

All rooms were a great size, some of the interiors were a little tired but generally 4.5&#47;5.  The food, the food - well you won&#39;t be disappointed.  Starters of muscles, garlic mushrooms and baked Camembert were thoroughly enjoyed following by the most amazing locally caught haddock and chips.  The portion did not warrant a starter.  The breakfast menu was extensive - not like we have seen in a while - and all meals were excellently presented and tasted wonderful.  The waiting staff were attentive and friendly and we wanted for nothing. The property is dog friend and they are very dog friendly indeed - thank you to Jack and his staff. Amazing - you won&#39;t regret staying at The Inn at Lathones.\n",

Breakfasts and evening meals were perfect in every way. Your tastebuds woke up with all the different tastes and flavours, the food was well presented and really cooked to perfection in every way. Staff were warm, attentive and very professional with impeccable courtesy and politeness. I think my only criticism would be that the hotel missed a lounge area, were you can relax and chill with a drink before eating.  The hotel would really benefit from such area and would really add value to the overall experiences. The surrounding area is perfect for dog walking and the canal is so quiet and relaxing. Whatever you do these days, it can be pricy, but I thought the prices to stay and eat where really reasonable and not out of the way. You get what you pay for without a doubt! It’s certainly worth a stay and to eat here. So would we go again? Yes, without a doubt as its so comfortable to stay here and the food is so divine and so dog friendly!\n",

      "Negative: Restaurant staff… the chef and waitress went out to Starbucks leaving the restaurant unattended and us waiting a while for our food. The manager did try to cover it up by saying they were washing up, but we could hear her telling staff the chef was missing and we watched them walk away and walk back with their drinks as we were sat by the entrance. Better to be honest to guests as everyone deserves a break, or make sure someone is covering when staff pop out.\n",

Haven&#39;t had this at any other hotel.  - Accessibility to the city centre from the other side of the river was a little less convenient than I thought: I expected the ferries to run later and more frequently on the weekend, but this wasn&#39;t the case.

Because the hotel has the same names for both types of standard (dog&#47;non).\n",

This place is squeaky clean. One thing I really like about this place is that it has been upgraded&#47;refurbished but only to a point that it made sense to; what I mean is that they didn&#39;t just tear out tiles or flooring etc that didn&#39;t need to be torn out because they still have alot life life yet before they actually need to be torn out and dumped in the landfill. The beds are super comfortable and so are the pillows and linens and the towels are nice and soft. Our room is dog friendly which is really helpful, and they have lil doggy beds and bowls etc available. Not to mention  ebikes and kayaks you can SIGN OUT ! The continental breakfast is really good and the pastries are fresh. Another bonus is being able to use the &#39;great room&#39; and play boardgames with our adult kids who live here in town.

Hosts were friendly, helpful and informative.  Plenty of useful thoughtful items provided - enough coffee, tea, sugar for our short stay (even a starter bottle of milk); washing up items, tea towel, lovely smelling hand soap in the ensuite - and should you want to use the shower, clearly labelled dispensers containing shampoo, conditioner and body soap can be found neatly placed on the window sill; whilst all towels, including a bathroom mat, lie neatly folded on the wall shelf rail. The surrounding hills and landscapes provide a beautiful, relaxing backdrop.\n",

There were weddings on both the Friday and Saturday so areas were busy at times.,5-6pm in the bar is hectic as all the wedding guests gather there whilst the Function room is being turned around for the evening do part so there is nowhere for the standard hotel guest to go which is a shame.

The rooms were spacious and all of the linens were crisp and clean. They had plenty of coffee in the room and any type of glasswear needed. They were very dog friendly, and everyone&#39;s pets were well behaved. We didn&#39;t hear a peep out of anyone else&#39;s dog the entire time. Kid friendly, dog friendly and a beautiful location! If you are traveling with family or with a dog, it&#39;s a great place to stay and feel welcomed.\n",

      "Positive: I wasn’t sure what to expect after reading a wide range of reviews but I’m sure glad I booked as this was a sleeper delight. It’s in north Palm Springs which is known as the uptown design district. Across the street from an authentic Italian restaurant with cuisine made by Italians, I paid as much for my dinner as I did the room but it was worth it. There’s fast food options across the street too along with a dog friendly coffee shop cafe. Breakfast is served off site at Ricks Restaurant which, true to the Inn’s description is only a 30 second car ride or 6 minute walk. Another high value plus with 2 hot choices for breakfast or you can use the coupon to order off menu for a $6 discount. I much prefer this experience to a stale muffin with a 2 hour feeding window, the restaurant is open for 7 hours! Another delightful surprise is the mid mod abstract art all around the property. Plus unlimited coffee, espresso, filtered water. While it is a 1950s building and there’s nothing sleek about it, I really enjoyed my stay. We felt safe and comfortable.\n",
      "Negative: It’s not in the middle of downtown, it’s by the Tram and in north Palm Springs. No issue for me because I enjoy hiking and walking. Those who are over 65 or inactive might not like the location.\n",

The deck outside, overlooking the property, was nice, where we spent most of our time. And they are very dog friendly, with a $25 per night fee.

      "Positive: I cannot recommend this hotel enough! ine if my favourite places. Such an amazing place! Can&#39;t believe they are dog friendly too! However if you do take your dog just note that they cannot stay in your room and are unable to go into the Chapel Restaurant and if you go to this hotel you have to eat in the chapel restaurant- it is stunning!! you can take dogs into the Courtyard restaurant which is lovely but the chapel is another level! That is also where breakfast is served so as we had the dog we had to eat in the courtyard and were the only ones in there but it was fine. The staff were all so lovely - had the feel of a small boutique hotel.\n",

Very quiet at night, couldn&#39;t hear other guests or disturbances in the house despite it being an older property. The bed was so comfortable, with exceptionally high quality, soft bedding. The hosts make a superb effort with breakfast, with locally and ethically sourced produce and homemade veggie sausages and baked beans that we loved. Even better that it was dog friendly! We were there to walk on the coastal trail and the location for this was amazing.\n",

The beds were comfortable, the accommodation was cool even in early July, even though the weather was good. There was a microwave in the kitchen and plenty of glasses and cutlery. There were also 3 balconies, a good sized one where we could eat outside. After dark there were lots of mosquitoes, so you should be prepared for that. The beach is also very close on foot, we liked the beach very much as it was not crowded. We will probably return again because the ground floor apartments are dog friendly and the beach is dog friendly.\n",

Dog friendly even though we don&#39;t have a dog it&#39;s great to see how much effort they are putting in to accommodate for pups, down to doggie treats in the reception. Amazing value for money. Complimentary drinks and snacks in the room is an added bonus. I&#39;m over the moon with our stay. Out of the hotels I have ever been to - Eastwood hall is absolutely THE BEST! They are clearly very environmentally conscious (which is very refreshing) room had a general waste and recycling bin.

Not only is there plenty of them but they also have usb and usb c outlets in them!\n",

As we enjoyed our last stay and the hotel is dog friendly we decided to visit again and booked a room last minute, last week for just two of us and our dog at what was a reasonable last minute price for two nights. However, this room was very tired, at the back of the hotel and was cold as there was no central heating only a small wall heater and portable electric heater. There were cobwebs under the pelmet over the beds, the drawers were broken and could not be used, the shower head was very flimsy plastic and the water that dribbled out was luke warm.  The tv remote control didn&#39;t work. Black carpet in the room was stained. We did ask to be moved but there were no other available rooms.

I hated tracking sand into the hotel   but it couldn&#39;t be helped.     The fitness room had only 1 cardio machine working.  The room is pretty small given the size of the hotel.

      "Negative: The lodge was a decent size but the heating was not switched on prior to our arrival and the place was absolutely freezing when we arrived. Also the lodge would benefit from a deep clean especially on the carpets all around the property. Furthermore it smelled like dogs a bit. I understand that it is a dog friendly place but travellers without a dog shouldn&#39;t suffer from the smell of other pets. Overall we had an ok stay because the surroundings are absolutely magnificent but I don&#39;t understand why you need to wait until 5pm to occupy the lodge if it is not even getting cleaned properly after guests.\n",

The dinner food was good but there were issues in the kitchen and the main courses took almost an hour to arrive. The only slight problem was that there was a small step into the bathroom. This was explained at reception but it would have been a good idea to point this out on room details when booking. The only other small point was the &#39;dog friendly&#39; attitude&#39;.

Properly dog friendly, with treats, blankets and poop bags ... nice and welcoming.\n",

I wasn&#39;t expecting a bungalow in the middle of a housing estate.  That said, the area was very peaceful.  The blinds in the bedroom were inadequate and let in the light from the street lamp in lane behind the garden. Only an issue for light sleepers.  Furniture wasn&#39;t that sturdy ( tv cabinet had been broken previously and bedroom wardrobe doors not built properly so fell off whenever opened). Not an issue once we knew what to expect.

      "Positive: Brilliant pub&#47;restaurant, with very friendly and attentive staff. We stayed over for one night, and our room was very comfortable and had everything we needed. It was Valentines Day, and the only food available was a special three course menu from which we were asked to make choices before we arrived. The quality of every course was excellent, with some original and interesting combinations. There was a great selection of well kept beers and wines (and gins!), and there was a good, filling breakfast in the morning. Very dog friendly, but not at the expense of cleanliness.\n",
      "Negative: The room was quite dark, with a sloping ceiling that made the bathroom quite tight. The Valentines menu was quite expensive, and whilst the food was very good it was not quite as good as I would have expected for the price - especially as it sells itself as the best gastropub in Worcestershire. It was a similar story with the breakfast, which was good but didn’t live up to the hype of previous reviewers. We were surprised that we were not offered anything else (eg. fruit juice, cereals, yogurt) other than our cooked breakfast and tea&#47;coffee.\n",

Also lots of attention to detail such as robes, slippers, complimentary drinks, quality tea, coffee and toiletries. The restaurant is good and the staff very efficient, friendly and courteous. Super dog friendly (not that we have a dog but like the ethos). Overall exceeded expectations which made our short stay in this lovely part of the world even more enjoyable.\n",

I realise we were a short notice booking and the restaurant was busy (a good sign and a reflection on the high standard) so the staff were a little pressed. Also we accept fresh items may be unavailable, so I think she was just a little unlucky in her choices.\n",

There seemed to be a problem with our key card and during our 3 night stay we had to have the key card reset 5 times.  We were advised when we booked that for some reason there was no lunches or dinners being served so we made other arrangements. Imagine our surprise when we checked in, to be asked if we wanted a table for dinner!  A bit late. But the very worse thing sadly was  the shower&#47;bath taps. It was a nightmare trying to set the temp, and it wasnt consistant to the point my husband got scolded. The high pitched squealling sound throughout this process was horrendous. First time it happened I got a fright as I thought is was a fire alarm. We didnt complain at the time as we were sure we wouldnt have been the first.

The food in the restaurant was very good, and the breakfast is exceptional.\n",
      "Negative: It is a good hotel, but there are small things that would still not make it great. We booked two standard rooms, one of us got a decent, spacious one, the other one a super small, very outdated one, so we were not sure why is the big difference. Pillows are not great, and it would be about time to replace the bedding and towels too. Very strange, that they don&#39;t provide any towels or sheet in the spa, and when we requested, the answer was take it from your room. However in our rooms, we only had one towel per person, which you don&#39;t want to use in the sauna. There is no bar available, only during the day till 5 pm for like 3 hours, and in general, it is very challenging to get a drink or anything. Staff is okay, but not super friendly, no hello, no smile, nothing. The hotel is next to a busy road, which makes it loud if you open the window for the night (if not, it is too warm, no A&#47;C).\n",

We have travelled extensively with her in Italy and France and she has never before been refused entrance to a restaurant or to a breakfast area in a hotel. Although we have never experienced any objection to her sitting quietly under our table, we do understand that not everyone would want dogs, no matter how well behaved, in their eating area. However, we did find it strange for this to happen in a hotel which we specifically chose because of its self-claimed dog-friendly attitude\n",

Dog friendly rather than dog tolerant - dog owners will appreciate the difference!\n",

      "Positive: From the moment we stepped into the hotel, Christopher gave us a warm welcome. We had our dog with us and prior to arriving Igor had already made sure that we did not have to worry about bringing him along as the Holiday Inn Express in Dyce was a dog friendly hotel and indeed as promised a treat was ready for little Otto upon arrival. All of the staff are friendly and helpful too. We do have to say that the pictures on the booking.com site don&#39;t do the rooms justice. Honestly, we loved the layout and comfort, and the room feels luxurious. We also loved it that we could bring our breakfast to the room as this is so much easier when you have a dog with you. We stayed in many airport hotels in Aberdeen now and it is amazing that during the weekend the Holiday Inn still serve breakfast early, this allows us to have a breakfast before our appointment at 08:00. Honestly we can highly recommend this hotel and have a already booked our next stay. Thank you team Holiday Inn Express Dyce for making our stay so enjoyable and being an excellent example of a hospitality expert.\n",

      "Positive: The caravan and site was clean and tidy with a central playground for children, you can sit on the wrap around veranda to watch them play and enjoy the view of the countryside. It&#39;s also dog friendly with bowls and blankets provided.  There&#39;s a small, well equipped, on-site shop &#47; PO with incredibly generous and trusting staff (thanks for the tea bags, I left the money on the counter Wednesday morning) Gilcrux is a nice little village but we didn&#39;t explore it too much as we couldn&#39;t seem to find footpaths, it could have been that we didn&#39;t look hard enough. However, it is a very good base to trip off to a variety of locations - Maryport Marina (11 mins), Cockermouth (10 mins), Aspatria (8 mins), Allonby (14 mins), Silloth (20 mins), Keswick (25 &#47; 30 mins) to name but a few.  There&#39;s a pub (The Masons Arms)  across the road from the site that serves food (Thurs, Fri, Sat after 5 and Sunday lunch until 2) we didn&#39;t have a chance to eat there but played pool and enjoyed a few drinks, the bar is well stocked, the pool room also has a dart board and other games and they accept dogs so it&#39;s a nice option if you just want to relax nearby.  All in all, we would stay here again. The host (Jo) is very friendly and responsive, thanks again Jo 🙂\n",
      "Negative: No WiFi, this wasn&#39;t a bad thing for me but the kids weren&#39;t happy that they actually had to talk to us and watch &quot;normal&quot; TV 😂  More eating options nearby, especially for breakfast and an evening meal, with The Masons not serving all the time.  I couldn&#39;t see access to the surrounding fields but if it&#39;s an option then signage &#47; direction would be good as it would be great to give the dog a good run first thing &#47; last off or just explore locally.  These don&#39;t really relate to the accommodation so if you want a good base for tripping off then this is it. If you don&#39;t plan on tripping off then ensure you stock up on essential food items, have a low maintenance dog, take board games etc. and have a good data package 🙂\n",

Although I knew that the hotel was dog friendly, I was under the impression that not every room catered for dogs. This was due to the fact that it said some rooms cater dogs on the question and answer section. We were allocated Willow room. When we first walked in, the smell of wet dog greeted us and there was dog hairs all over the bed. As I said, due to personal preference I asked to be moved room which at that point was told all the rooms were dog friendly. Despite this, the staff were very accommodating and moved us to another room on the top floor which we greatly appreciated and so thankful for. This room was much better and less dog evident as it was a top floor room.   If there was a mention on the booking page that all rooms are dog friendly and this was made clearer it would help others to know whether they would want to stay as I would have avoided booking if I had known based on this reason only.\n",

Whilst the room was large and comfortable it was very dimly lit and I didn&#39;t like this and would have preferred better lighting.    This particular room opened directly onto the pavement alongside the main road through the village of Thornham.  Traffic noise was not a problem but I would have preferred a room that felt more secure (being a single female guest) within the main hotel building which has an outer security door that only guests have the key to.\n",

      "Negative: The standard of finish in the room was poor. We must not have been allocated a recently refurbished room. We were on the top floor with our dog who has very short legs which was somewhat inconvenient. It would have been more practical be placed in a ground level room. The balcony on our room was dire. The paint was peeling almost all over and the wooden divider between balconies was falling apart. The bathroom was dated and the shower had poor pressure. The TV in the room is bad and does not have satellite channels as per this website. There was no fridge and no water in our room either, which according to the website we should have at least had water. I saw only one communal bin, which for a dog friendly hotel seems a bit light.    The &quot;bar&quot; food we ordered one night was average at best with literally one appropriate option. The breakfast isn&#39;t the best.    It&#39;s very expensive for drinks and food but the overall experience is underwhelming.\n",

Clean and good facilities provided in the room.  Very dog friendly with an area of the restaurant set aside to take your dog for meals should you wish.\n",
      "Negative: Breakfast, toast always cold and limited continental choice. Unfortunately there was a break down in communication with some of the serving staff who clearly didn’t understand what was being asked for due to language barriers. On checking out the smell of someone smoking was very unpleasant to the point I mentioned it, I believe a member of staff had just come in from a cigarette break and all their clothes and hair smelt of it. Not a very good impression at the reception.  We paid extra for a deluxe double room as a special occasion and although it gave us a sitting room we did not feel it offered good value as was in the attic of the hotel and the view was very limited due to the window being a small porthole.\n",

Try the scallops, they&#39;re to die for! Make sure to reserve a table, especially if it&#39;s quiet, as the kitchen may close early!

Parking:  checking in was a challenge given the lack of outside parking.  You can&#39;t access the garage until you check in.  That&#39;s not a criticism, just what is the norm.

That says more about our dog than the hotel but something to bear in mind if you have a reactive dog.

      "Positive: The staff are very professional and sorted out a few issues I had during my stay. My original room was in the west wing so not actually the main building, I would not recommend staying in the new building it&#39;s not upto the standard of a 4 star hotel without going into the problem I seen. If you are not able to walk long distance then this property is not for you. I was upgraded to the main building due the issues with my original room and the staff provided a  5 star service this made up for the not so great stuff. The room service rood was not great but again the staff were amazing but it was very over priced. The breakfast was great and included in my stay. The gym and swimming pool also great free of charge. I would recommend eating at the ego fox restaurant value for money and the service and food was spectacular dog friendly and 1 mile away. The hotel was also dog friendly which we loved and plenty of space to walk around the grounds which are very well maintained and clean. Overall I would say the hotel is in need of a refurb expecially the bathrooms. Choice of food is very limited also. If you have a medium sized van you can not park in the main car park due to hieght barrier which we was unaware of, so we had to park quite a distance from reception. I would stay again due to do the exceptional service from the staff and being so dog friendly, overall we had a nice stay. The staff really make this hotel shine thank you.\n",

Lack of bins for dog waste, two old buckets were overflowing from days of dog waste, disgusting! A beautiful house that needs considerable updating, decor wise. Holes on room walls, many dinks and dents in walls, wallpaper missing, holes in carpets.. all symptomatic of a hotel chain not wanting to invest in updating. Black mold in shower, come on, it&#39;s not hard to eradicate. Clearly not been takled for months.  Food prices. The restaurant menu offers  2 or 3 courses, 2 courses was £34.50 each. The portions were small.. not worth the money. In my opinion, the hotel is cashing in.\n",

I must say that despite my comments about the things I didn’t like, we had a pleasant stay, staff were friendly and the room and facilities were lovely, so we would stay again. it was really nice to have a dog friendly room that was so nice, rather than feeling we had been palmed off with the worst rooms in the hotel - which I assume was not the case.\n",
      "Negative: We were not informed of a wedding at the venue nor that because of this there was no food being served in the evening of our stay. (luckily we had already planned to eat out, and the noise from the wedding did not reach our room). the literature on website stated £10 for dogs, booking.com states both £30 and £10 but I had to search hard for both bits of info on this. there were dog waste specific bins but receptionist was unable to tell me where it was. website stated by the lake but access to the lake on the Saturday was closed off, although this was not the case on the Sunday morning. I moved the bedside cabinet to plug in my phone and found 3 pieces of stained tissues so maybe a little bit more attention to detail with the cleaning as the skirting and carpet was a little bit dusty too. the rest of the room and bathroom were spotless though.\n",

      "Negative: We came here as it was &quot;dog friendly&quot; and while dogs are allowed to stay, the rest of the hotel is not really set up for it. We were given a ground floor room that opened onto a courtyard so that was really handy. But there&#39;s nowhere inside to eat for example, you have to go to the brasserie restaurant and sit outside. There were only a few drops of rain thankfully but it&#39;s not ideal. When it came to breakfast thankfully it was cool enough that the dog could stay in the car while we ate. I think you should probably either rethink the options for those visiting with dogs and consider what they are supposed to do in all scenarios, or maybe don&#39;t offer it out as a dog friendly venue.\n",

The pub is exceptionally well run, very clean and very dog friendly.  Room was spacious and very clean.  Lovely views over the water and a bonus pair of binoculars on the window seat.  En suite bathroom very clean.  No problem bringing two dogs into the pub and they slept happily on the floor in the bedroom.  The pub has great reviews and justifiably so.   It was busy on Saturday evening and we were lucky enough to book the last table.  Breakfast is cooked to order but we just had cereal and toast as we&#39;re not full english types!  Bread was lovely - not from a basic sliced loaf.  Staff were very accommodating.  Will definitely return.\n",

The staff were incredibly friendly &amp; helpful but appeared to lack some experience &#47; knowledge.  There were several items not available to order on the menu, but we were only told once we&#39;d made our choices and it took a couple more attempts to find a dish that we liked that was available to order.  It would have been very helpful to have been advised up front what wasn&#39;t available.  The bottle of wine we chose also wasn&#39;t available as well as a beer that we wanted. That having been said, the food that we did have was delicious.    The dog friendly restaurant &#47; bar is a really lovely area but unfortunately,  it closes at 10pm.  The only other bar on site which is open later, isn&#39;t dog friendly.  The hotel doesn&#39;t appear to have many facilities nearby (not that we could see - we weren&#39;t familiar with the area at all), so we found we were having to go back to our room at 10pm each night because we had our dog with us.\n",

      "Positive: Beautiful resort with quite a picturesque beach. Ideal for families, not so much for couples. The facility newly built, with everything in order.  Location: Location was great, one of the cleanest areas on the island, with everything you may need is nearby. A 7-eleven just 2 mins walk from the resort.  Room: It was very comfortable in terms of size and the bed and pillows were great. The balcony is huge with perfect views of the pool, as we were on the first floor, the ground floor rooms had direct access to the pool. They arranged a baby cot as well. Sockets in the room were where needed, so no complains from the room.  Spa: Spa was great too, from what my wife told me, she had an amazing massage there. A bit overpriced but they gave us a 20% discount for no reason, which was great.  Gym and pool: The fitness centre was decent with all the necessary machines, mostly empty. There was a snooker and piano room next to it, where people could also catch up with their work.  The pool was massive, spanning throughout the resort. There was a separate kids pool with slides as well. A drawback at the adult pool was that people would hog the sunbeds with their towels and leave for hours, sometimes towards the beach or restaurant, which was not okay. The staff should give it 30 mins after which they should make those beds available for other guest.  Nursery: There was a nursery where couples could leave their kids of 4 years above in their supervision while they could relax, although we couldnt benefit from it as our baby was just 9 months old.. 🙈  Breakfast: Breakfast was good, nothing exceptional though. Very crowded after 9, with not so great management of the buffet after that, so i would suggest going earlier.  Beach: It was quite beautiful, and it came pretty close to the resort after the rain, uploading some pictures and videos for reference.\n",
      "Negative: 1. There is no elevator in the hotel (but they bring your luggage to and from your room), although still not great to not have elevator option for first and second floor. 2. The resort is massive so going to the beach frequently was not very convenient, but there were spots where they would pick you up in a buggy and drop you to the beach. Still a bit of an inconvenience.  3. Not very stroller and wheelchair friendly, as the design of the resort has stairs and bridges going above the pool, we had to lift the stroller many times, taking the baby out of it, same for going up to the room on the first floor.   But the positives definitely outweigh the negatives.\n",

Everyone was a joy to speak with and wanted us to have a smile. We loved the feel of several resort options for views and for dining. Thank you so much for making my Mom comfortable, you provided for needs as requested and she exceeded our expectations by not once asking for the wheelchair. your buggy drivers and all staff looked out for her and one pool attendant even walked with us to the dining room to assist her up the steps. The tilers and ground staff always gave a cheery hello and am sure that is why all the plants make an effort to give the best blooms possible.

If you are a wheelchair user I suggest you get pictures of the room including the bathroom.\n",

      "Positive: Good parking. Got extra towels when needed.  Traveling with a disabled adult daughter who, when showering in the roll-in shower, gets water all over the bathroom floor.  Can’t help it.  Thus the need for more towels.  Only reason I booked your site (far from where we actually needed to be as no other sites were available with roll-in shower) was because of the roll-in shower.\n",
      "Negative: 1. The bathroom!  Mold in the shower!!! Didn’t appear that the shower had been used for awhile. Very difficult to pull out and push in the handle for the water.  The shower “wall” was coming loose from the wall.  Needs re-gluing. Broken tiles as baseboard.  There is a wall between the toilet and the vanity.  Very difficult for my daughter to transfer onto the toilet. Not a good set up!    2. We had to take an elevator to parking and to go to the office on main level. Dangerous situation for wheelchair-bound people.  Wasn’t told if there was another safer exit.\n",

      "Positive: We stayed from Sunday Night to Saturday Morning. We were in a 2 bedroom unit on the bottom floor that was a disabled room. The room itself was very clean and tidy and had most things we could have wanted (large size fridge&#47;freezer, reasonable stove and oven, all the plates and bowls, (Although bigger sized bowls would have been good for breakfasts), bath and pool towels in the rooms, a good TV and comfy couches). All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The grounds were beautifully maintained and the pool was great.\n",
      "Negative: We would not choose this room again for a few reasons (but would stay here again).  As a tall family the lower kitchen benches weren&#39;t ideal, but as a disability room, they would have been perfect (They even thought about how someone in a wheelchair could get to the sink and had an empty space under the sink behind the cupboard doors so you could get your wheelchair under it). The biggest issue for us being on the ground floor was the noise from above.  Even just normal walking around the room above created noise in our room.  We had early risers (5.30am some mornings) and this woke us as they were moving around. If I was to book here again, I would probably request a room with no other room above, or be the one in the upstairs room.\n",

The location was ideal, plus it offered the best deal on Booking.com. I was able to look around, and the room, lobby, and  hallway were clean,  plus roomy for my wheelchair and husband to walk beside me. The door entrance to the hotel was automatic, which led you to the lobby and the front, which immediately to your right.

There is a great little grocery store downstairs, as well as a nice café. We didn’t try the Japanese restaurant, but the fourth level restaurant and bar were quite fine. The location was really good. as a wheelchair user, the accessible apartment was quite adequate. There were a few issues in the bathroom, but it was pretty accessible. I’m not sure I would recommend it for quadriplegics though, But paras should do just fine here. The bed was just the right height for getting into, and there was plenty of space in the apartment to move around in a chair. All in all, a great value for the money If you’re planning a family trip to Vietnam.\n",

They didn&#39;t seem to have any other option for me. Luckily I am able to mobilise and was able to climb the stairs with help.   Breakfast was lovely but there were no vegan or gluten free options.  Upon leaving the Terrace, you have to go back to your floor using a lift. There is an extremely high gradient ramp into the lift which without assistance, would be impossible to use. It&#39;s a typical example of an adaptation made by an able bodied person.   I didn&#39;t use the pool&#47;spa&#47;gym area but my family did and they said I wouldn&#39;t be able to in my chair and the only viewing area was from the gym.   We didn&#39;t book an accessible room so I can only speak for the normal access rooms but the door was extremely heavy. There was no chance I could open the door on my own. If the accessible room doors are the same, I would consider adding an electric opener.  It would be nice to see more than a bottle of water in a family room. As a family of 4 sharing the room, a single bottle of water didn&#39;t go very far during the night and we were all gasping by the morning.\n",

Sarah&#39;s taco dinners are excellent and good value. The fresh fruit plate is lovely. free potable water, much appreciated. My room was large, bright and airy, my ensuite bathroom, impeccably clean. The bed would have been one of the most comfortable, BUT for the polyester sheets. (See below)\n",
      "Negative: The reason my property ratings vary so much is because when I booked, the description of my room said it had a private kitchenette. I assumed at minimum, I would have a mini fridge and a kettle in my room. I did not. The communal kitchen does not even have a kettle to boil water for tea or coffee, just a pot, difficult to pour into a coffee filter cup. When I pointed out the discrepancy, on February 18 or 19, the &quot;private kitchenette&quot; disappeared from the website room description. I would not have booked a weeklong stay if I had known there was no private kitchenette.   As well, the room description continues to claim it is &quot;wheelchair accessible&quot;. There is no way on earth a person using a wheelchair could ever get through the 20-inch-wide rocky path to the back courtyard, and climb 18 inches onto the deck that leads to the room entrance. In fact, the leap to and from the deck and room entrance is difficult and possibly dangerous for anyone. Even though that misinformation didn&#39;t affect me personally, I am shocked you continue to say the room is wheelchair accessible.  I cannot sleep on bed sheets are 100% polyester without waking every couple of hours in damp sheets and a cold sweat, so I slept terribly and am still recovering. The policy to change the sheets every day is wasteful. (Who does that in their own home?) Instead, save yourself the labour and energy cost and at least have some cotton sheets on hand for people sensitive to synthetic fabric. The initial pension I stayed at, similarly located, has rooms with ensuite bathrooms, beds with cotton sheets, a kettle and mini-fridge, all for a price that is less than what you charge. I wished I stayed there the whole time.\n",

If it had been a queen size bed instead of a king size there would have been more room.

Just something to note if you are offered this room type.   This is a renowned FAMILY hotel, so it left a bad taste that we were told to keep the children quiet at dinner when they were just talking and laughing like other adults around them. Of course they can be bold and wild at times, but at dinner, they were not bold at all, just laughing and excited chatter. 2 couples complained that there were children on the property after 7 and moved to other tables (we booked dinner for 6 so as to get them to bed after and not to disturb other diners), the waiter explained that it was a family hotel. I have no problem with them moving if they wanted, but for the waiter to tell us to keep the kids quiet when they were very much entitled to be there and were not as loud as some squiffy adults was really a bit much.   If you don&#39;t like kids, go somewhere else, stay in an ADULTS ONLY hotel and find something else to complain about. Breakfast was very pleasant but the dinner issue left a sour taste afterwards.\n",

They spoke (French) to Hertz in Carcassonne and managed to organize the return of our vehicle. . . .  . . we will be forever in their debt for their kindness and personal assistance. Rating: 8&#47;10\n",
      "Negative: The only negatives were that the property was located some four kms from Carcassonne, requiring a car to get into the town. The small size of the room which made  accommodation  of our 4 large suitcases a challenge, leaving little room to walk. The necessity to lug our suitcases up a flight of stairs to our room and  the absence of a refrigerator, especially when we had milk (for coffee in the morning and a few bottles of white wine). The Breakfast though quite good, was optional.  Our unit was described as being a Superior Double Room which was wheelchair accessible . . .in fact our accommodation was a single room with a separate bathroom on the first floor, hardly wheelchair accessible\n",

And beautiful accomodation and transport\n",
      "Negative: The ramp to the stables is too steep- especially the one just opposite the stairs. A wheelchair user wouldn’t be able to use it on their own.  My partner is someone that prefers being independent as much as possible and would prefer a flatter ramp so he doesn’t have to be helped to go down or up to the room.  The bench in the shower made of tiles can be a little uncomfortable for the wheelchair user- maybe a fold over chair would have been better.l and more comfy.\n",

The food is excellent with such a varied spread. Absolutely lovely.  Also the Spa… just wow. Typically, I prefer to use spas outside of hotels as they usually don’t measure up, but this was absolutely amazing. The Spa manager deserves a shout out as she was very accommodating and helpful  One last thing….the weekend entertainment was great. On the Saturday we had a brilliant saxophonist play some classics and on Sunday we had some local music and dancing. Very nice touch to the weekend.  I had a brilliant stay.\n",

We stayed in an accessible room, whilst we did not require accessibility as we were both able bodied, it was just the room we were given on check in. I work with children and adults with disabilities, the complimentary soap, shower gel and shampoo were all placed at the back of the higher sink unit, had we been wheelchair users, they would have been out of reach for us to use, it wasn’t an issue for myself or my daughter but it may be worth considering this when setting the bathroom up.

      "Positive: Hotel Tissage was the most pleasant hotel experience I have ever had in my life. I am a physically disabled wheelchair user and a vegetarian, and my Japanese is very limited. The staff here went out of their way at every turn to help me find restaurants to eat at, cab rides to places I needed to go to, and even wheeled me twice to the local 7-11 (5 minutes away) to help me withdraw cash, waiting for me and wheeling me back with never a complaint. Some of the staff speak excellent English or Chinese, and those who don&#39;t were quick to use translation apps to help me communicate with them. Rooms are spacious, clean, and secure, such that I never felt cramped or uncomfortable. The bathroom was made with elderly or disabled people in mind, with an easy to use tub and detachable shower, even including a &quot;panic cord&quot; in case you slipped in the shower, and a seat at the back of the tub for ease of use. The toilet is a washing unit with instructions in Japanese, English, Korean, Chinese, and Braille, very comfortable and easy to use. Breakfast is the only meal served, and offers a continental style assortment of Japanese fare, all of it tasty and affordable. Wifi is fast and reliable. I suppose that the room and breakfast are relatively standard for Japanese hotels; but I have never in my whole life stayed in a hotel where the staff were as friendly, accommodating, and helpful as Hotel Tissage. The rates are also much cheaper here than at other hotels I searched, and everywhere I&#39;ve wanted to go has been about 10-15 minutes away by cab, leading me to believe that it is fairly centrally located.

This place is absolutely stunning! If you love paintings, old maps, frescos, books, history and architecture, this is the place to stay when you are in Bolsena, an ancient Etruscan town near Lake Bolsena, the biggest volcanic lake in Europe.  It will take too long to describe this magnificent palazzo (please see some photos I took instead), but it felt like staying in a palace, a library, an art gallery and a museum - all combined!   We stayed in two double rooms connected by a private corridor, tastefully decorated and tucked away on the third floor of the enormous building. Apart from the 16 guest rooms there are many theme rooms (ie China Room), halls, dining rooms, and even a private chapel where past popes celebrated masses. Guests can even rent an audio guide while walking around the palazzo, if they want to delve deeply into the history of the palazzo and the family who owns it.\n",

      "Positive: Lisa and Dave were wonderful hosts, from the moment I walked in the door with a thorough introduction to organising my transport to the airport for an early morning flight after I checked out.  The apartment is spacious, airy, light, and yet very quiet. It is minutes on foot from the ferry to Valletta. The heating took the chill from the air in the cool evenings, the bathroom was clean and easy to use, windows can be opened and have fly screens, there was lots of closet space, there was a coffee machine and pods, a medium-sized fridge, and plates and cutlery, etc. for two people, and big bottles of drinking water were provided (and replenished each day). The bed was comfortable and there were lots of pillows. There is a small balcony and also a separate shared roof terrace. My apartment was on the fourth floor, and there is an elevator (and stairs). Wheelchair users, note that there are a few steep steps at the entrance to the building and one step up into the apartment itself, so some mobility would be required, but the apartment itself including the bathroom are sufficiently spacious to get around in a wheelchair. Finally, there is a very good, large supermarket (Welbee) within 10 minutes walk; you cannot cook at the apartment (there is no stove) but there is a new microwave oven. Oh, and adapters for European plugs to be able to use the English three-pronged power points were thoughtfully provided.  I really enjoyed my stay here, and would recommend it to other solo travellers or couples who would like a quiet base in a very convenient location in Sliema. The hosts were lovely, and everything thoughtfully provided for a relaxing stay.\n",

Maybe it&#39;s also from the drain idk. 5) Door lock for bathroom is faulty 6) No free drinks, even mineral water 7) My room was so small, you need to open your cabin sized luggage on bed.

Breakfast was a full buffet of hot and cold food. There was a constant flow of staff to ensure the food and drinks were available. Train station within 3 minutes walking distance however it was out of service when we stayed. 10-minute scooter ride to get into the city and start to sight see. Roads were wide enough for cars &#47; bikers and e-scooters. Quiet area to be able to walk out and not into the hussle of the city noise &#47; traffic.

Lift to get your luggage up easily, however there are about 3 steps from the street to the lift, so it wouldn’t be suitable for a wheelchair user. Fine for a stroller to be pulled up, though.  Washing machine was brilliant as we arrived with most of our clothes ready for a wash. There was a drying rack provided that I set up in front of the radiator and jeans were dry the next day (December).  We couldn’t believe our luck with how great the flat was, especially for the price.\n",
      "Negative: The entry is typical of old council flats, stark and functional, so not the most inviting, but it’s not indicative of the flat or the area, it’s just what you get in London. It didn’t bother us at all. Covent Garden and subsequent tube stations are very busy at all times, but that’s what you get when you’re in the heart London where tourists and locals going about their business converge.  The bathroom is tiny, but again, typical for London.   None of these detracted from our stay, but they’re worth noting for people who may find these an issue.\n",

      "Positive: It&#39;s hard to find good hotels in Catania for a reasonable price so my comments should be seen in this light. The location is very good and central to all shops, restaurants and sites though 2 bus rides (about 30-40 minutes) or a 25 Euro taxi or hotel shuttle to or fom the airport. The reception was very friendly and helpful.  The room we had was at the rear, very high ceilinged but a little dingy, the noisy rattling aircon clearly in need of repair (though it did heat the room effectively). Room was large and so was the bathroom, though the (hot, effective) shower stall was bizarrely tiny.  Bed and pillows pretty firm. Small TV with no satellite.  Breakfast very good with large mugs of excellent coffee. The rooms are on the first floor and the lift is very old fashioned and small.  You will be met by a large blank closed door on arrival at the building but press the bell with the wheelchair symbol and they will buzz you in (after arrival you get your own key).\n",

Kept getting sent to different places in the hotel but no one could help. Eventually reception told us about a lift in the spa. Would have been useful to know this when we arrived. The hotel was so amazing apart from this. But 2023 and no way to access the pool on wheels. That&#39;s crazy. A lady in a wheelchair was also in the same position.\n",

      "Negative: Not enough plugs in between beds. But the room weirdly had plugs in very odd spots. Lighting is awful in our room. Brighter lights would be so helpful. If you wear makeup bring a mirrored light and if you have bad sight good luck. It would be very helpful to have a shelf for the bathroom as the sink area is smaller. The shower curtain will hit your leg if u don’t put a towel to block it. Water runs out because the bottom lip does nothing. I believe it is for wheelchair accessibility but definitely could be a falling hazard. Housekeeping never came to our room so we had to ask for extra towels and tiny hand soaps. The good outweighs the bad though!\n",

When we arrived  we were shown the scooter safely tucked away behind a door at reception, awesome service from both Ozhire in Cairns and the hotel. The centre is a bit of a walk away but almost all the way you can walk along the Esplanade and the ocean.

Dinner at the Thai restaurant was delicious.\n",

CLEANLINESS: When we arrived the apartment seemed spotless, however we soon noticed a dead bug and a lot of ants. I contacted the hosts and they came within ten minutes to completely fix the issue, then came back the following day to ensure that it was all good. I’ve never had such quick service and such efficiency from a place. Honestly fantastic.  LOCATION: Absolutely amazing, down a quiet side street, only a ten minute walk from Setas de Sevilla, and a 3 minute walk from a large shopping area. But was also so so so quiet. We were on the ground floor, with our bedroom right on the street, and honestly didn’t hear a thing, and I’m quite a light sleeper.  PRICE: very reasonable, obviously slightly more expensive than a hotel, but you save so much on having your own kitchen etc.  THE ACTUAL APARTMENT: we had an apartment on the ground floor, so paid extra for a small patio just off from the living room, and that was wonderful. There is also an amazing terrace on the top floor for all guests, with two sun loungers, two very large sofa seating areas and even a bathroom. There was an elevator for all floors too. However you do have to go up three steps to go up to the terrace so not fully wheelchair accessible.  We had a dishwasher and a washing machine and we’re given a few tablets for each, we did end up buying our own, but we always do this as we do a lot of laundry due to travelling light.\n",

This is not a hotel, hard to locate and instructions not clear. Make sure you have WhatsApp as instructions will be sent to you this way.

I like the way the rooms are individually themed, and I like the way the whole hotel has a Turkish flavour to it (e.g. Turkish rugs, Turkish perfume, Turkish staff). It makes it feel quite exotic, in a good way!\n",
      "Negative: I was given a wheelchair accessible room (Galileo), which was great as I suspect it was larger than their usual single rooms - it could have easily been a double. The only downside is it meant the bathroom door has an alarm light which was green, presumably changing colour to red if the alarm is sounded outside of it, this light cannot be switched off, and shines directly into your eyes when in bed. It sounds petty (and it is), but they need to shield that light from the line of sight of the bed.\n",

      "Positive: Practically everything! There are so many amazing things to say about this place, I&#39;ll just go in order:    1) They were VERY prompt and communicative over booking.com chat for my questions and requests for my sister who is on a wheelchair.     2) They have a free shuttle bus service for pickup from the train&#47;bus station and a dropoff. AND for whenever you want to visit anywhere in Hakuba that&#39;s within a 10 min drive diameter. HOW COOL IS THAT?! An absolute highlight and USP of this place.    3) THE STAFF! Omg, the staff is some of the BEST I&#39;ve ever seen in all of my stays around the world. In particular, their managers Thomas and Rena. I cannot emphasize how immensely helpful they both were throughout my stay there working around the clock to ensure we had the best time. Seriously, words cannot describe how great they were and I cannot thank them enough.    4) Thomas, who was coordinating with me over messages before my arrival; made whatever possible arrangements for my handicapped sister to ensure she had the smoothest time and I am incredibly thankful to him for that. Not only this, he personally took so much time and effort to make sure we got to do the activities we wanted and made all sorts of arrangements including arranging for ski rentals and inquiring with the resorts before we got there.     Anyone from the Wadano team reading this, please make sure this guy is taken care of well. He truly is the crown jewel of our experience there.    5) The hotel itself is equipped with an awesome lounge area with a pool table, Foosball, board games and plenty of spaces to relax and unwind. Never had a dull time while I was there.    6) The rooms were wonderful and spacious. A perfect blend between modern hotel rooms on one side and a Japanese inn kinda feeling on the other.      Overall, this was the best stay we had out of all of the places we visited in Japan.\n",
      "Negative: The only things I&#39;d say weren&#39;t great here were:    1) The breakfast menu. Not a proper buffet and the meals weren&#39;t that great to be honest. Although I think that&#39;s probably because we visited at a time when there were very few guests.    2) There&#39;s one central wifi in the hotel for everyone to use. The signal in the rooms therefore is quite weak.    But that&#39;s all.\n",

We’ll definitely stay there again. Also all the zoo theme stuff in the rooms and lobby are adorable.\n",
      "Negative: Things you should know. There is no elevator, it’s a very stairs reliant hotel. Our original room was upstairs and they were kind enough to fix it for us to be downstairs. The room access is in the back of the building but there is a set of stairs inside that takes you to the front desk&#47;breakfast area&#47;pool. Wheelchair access is a little complicated here but it’s still doable. Since stairs are so important here you’d have to take the long way for everything (pool on side, breakfast through the front, access to rooms in the back etc.) I still highly recommend them regardless but I didn’t know about the stairs so I felt like it was really important that it was written somewhere.   Also If your someone that loves a really big room than this might not be your place. The rooms are very small but  the beds were comfortable. Everything in the room worked great for us.

Not many hangers provided, by the way. But I am sure they would have provided more if I could have just asked. Some reviews said that the propery was dirty but my room is clean. Location is good. There is a supermarket nearby, and the dried food and snacks were cheap. But if you go there late, you should not expect to see any cooked food leftover because they were gone very fast!

My husband has been sufferred from a neuro desease, so he&#39;s loosing the moving capacities. He has been in a wheelchair, but he can walk a bit but his legs are shaking and he has a high risks to collapse. Everytime, we entered the building, he had to get up and walked through the main entrance because the door is too narrow for the wheelchair to go through. We had to fold it and went after him. Moreover, when entering the lift, he had to stand and lean against the wall while we brought the folded wheelchair in. The lift&#39;s door was also too small for the wheelchair. This is to note that the wheelchair is a Japanese brand, so  there should not be any further comments about its size because it is Japanese standard.   3.There were cracks and damaged walls without any signs of an attempt to repair.

I had some clothes laying under the sink and they were absolutely drenched. We had to use a towel to push the water towards the drain as the floor didnt slope towards it so it wouldnt have gone itself, leaving us with a wet floor to contend with anytime we needed to use the toilet. We could also hear anytime anyone in the room above us used the bathroom. If the hotel hadnt been as expensive as it was we could have forgiven that but for the price you’d expect a little more privacy. We mentioned the bathroom flooding issue to the front desk staff and he said he would make a note of it, however all he did was flick through some pages in his diary, pretend to write an entry then proceeded to give us incorrect information about where we could get some change in the local area.   Our room looked like it was supposed to be accessible for wheelchair users but there was no way to get past the bed to get to the bathroom.   The sink was too close to the toilet and anyone over 15 stone might have an issue sitting comfortably.  The lift is also too small for a wheelchair so the whole hotel is not accessible. Why have an accessible bathroom when there are steps leading up to the hotel?   The bed was too firm and not very comfortable.  The price is way too high for the service and facilities provided.\n",

The bathroom is completely wheelchair friendly anf full of toiletries. The beach is really right in front of your concertina doors that you can open wide to get the full impact of the sea, the view and the fresh sunny air. Truly lovely and spectacular. So worth a visit. Wish we could have stayed longer.\n",
      "Negative: No fault with the venue which is perfect in more ways than one. Sadly, we could only spend 1 of our three nights booked. We are so disappointed that we have to leave early but we had to get home. Due the big storm that passed through the Cape and Overberg on the Sunday and Monday, we had to cut our stay short. Our home was impacted by the storm with the Overberg roads closed, flooded, washed away, no power, no sewerage, no security and no water. Really hoping to return and have some fun and relaxing time in this beautiful place.\n",

The room was excellent, my husband is in a wheelchair so accessible accommodation was really important, it did not let us down this is a great room for any guests that have mobility issues. The wet room was well designed, clean and easy for my husband to use. The bedroom had plenty of room and storage with a lovely tea tray. We could park our vehicle right outside and the view from the room across the estuary was lovely.    We ate every night in the pub and the food was fab, great portions, Sea Bass was to die for, so good I had it 2 consecutive nights. Matthew the big little chef cooked some lovely food and Big Matthew behind the bar kept us well topped up on drinks. They serve a really good selection of wines, spirits, beers and real ales. I took a liking to the Madrid on tap, lovely beer, clean and crisp just like the pipes.    Breakfast was amazing, full English, cereals, fresh coffee all freshly cooked to order. We had a wonderful waitress in the morning and I am sorry to say I have forgotten her name, but she will remember, she was lovely and polite and really looked after us.    It was my husbands birthday whilst we were there and they did balloons, banners and a birthday cake was a lovely touch that really made my husbands day.

      "Negative: We didn’t know we were staying in room 1 which was a wheelchair accessible room, but was nice and spacious. however location wise in the building meant it was extremely noisy. Walls were painfully thin.  the room is basically in reception.  Until late there was a doorbell ringing for customers checking in, and loud voices and again started again by 6.30am for those going in and out checking out.  Once guests all checked in, we listened to the night staff member sitting on the couch directly opposite our room chatting loudly on the phone whilst doing some kind of crafting at the nook table. But eventually by midnight I had to go out and ask her to politely shut up, to which she in fairness did. we never heard another peep.   In the morning, we came out for breakfast at around 7.40am and a different staff member was on the self serve breakfast duty. there was no cups for tea, no teabags, no fruit and no milk. I asked for one and then each time she went away I realized the next thing wasn’t there either and so sadly had to keep asking for things - I felt so bad constantly asking, but she never once made me feel reassured, she huffed and I felt like it was my fault and so was consistently apologizing (when really I shouldn’t be doing any such thing since I paid for bed and board).

While researching the hotel before my stay, there were several people complaining that the elevator stops in between floors, and you have to either go up or down a small flight of stairs.

On arrival Shannon was on the desk and was very helpful and accommodating.  Assisted myself, grandson and granddaughter to our ground floor room with a multitude of bags as we do not travel lightly.

On arrival at breakfast the following morning, served by Liam.  Breakfast was arranged for myself and my 4yr old granddaughter.  It was only on leaving I was charged full for the breakfast as I was classed as a walk-in.  I put my point across that I had enquired about breakfast and was not invited to prebook as I was a guest staying in the hotel.

No firm mattresses for elders. My almost eighty year old elder had to sleep sitting up in a desk chair because the mattress was too soft for their body. And, the bed was too high for them or a child to climb up in. And, remove the hard metal stump your toe bases out from under these beds.  No regard for elders that need a higher toilet seat, yet the are NOT wheelchair&#47;handicapped bound. Stop shrinking the rooms walk around space.  No vegan&#47;vegetarian breakfast options and pitiful regular breakfast options. There are two many restaurants around you that compete and take away from your profit margin at a better price point because because cheap effort is placed on the breakfast offerings.  Chasing the European Joneses and teen youth craze while disregarding our elders in restaurants, hotels, bathrooms, museums, etc will come back to haunt your company.  Without elders we &#47;you wouldn&#39;t be here to build a company, and you eill one day be an elder and wouldn&#39;t be able to comfortably maneuver your own hotel rooms.

It&#39;s about 25-30 minutes walking to the Cathedral, but we wandered a bit and so it took longer!  Close to lovely neighbourhood squares with good food and drink, frequented by locals, which is always a good indicator.  Lovely large room (we got a wheelchair-accessible room) on the ground floor, with super-comfy bed, sofa and chairs.  Ingenious kitchen in a closet, plus wardrobe.  The courtyard is absolutely beautiful, and the &quot;Honesty Bar&quot; is an added bonus after a late night walk back from town.

Access to the lovely Palacio after which the hotel is named, and informative audio guide.\n",

The breakfast is delivered in a basket to the room, after ordering the previous evening. Butter, milk, honey, yogurt all in tiny plastic single-use pots. The bread rolls were nothing special, and the ham was unfortunate. Stated as &quot;York ham&quot;, but not sure the people of York would be very happy with it. Croissants horribly stale.  Toiletries all in tiny, single-use plastic pots.  Tiny ceramic cups in the closet-kitchen were chipped.  As mentioned, it was a wheel-chair accessible room, but the pull cord for assistance in the shower room was tied up, so was useless. Also, cups, plates etc in a cupboard far too high for me to reach, so a wheelchair user would find it impossible too.  The wardrobe hanging rail is over a shelf so dresses were not able to hang but were crumpled at the hem due to the shelf.

      "Positive: The check in process was simple and very efficient. A couple of days prior to our arrival we received an email with a step by step arrival process. And a link to Att app. After downloading the app and upon arrival you will receive a code and your room details. Now for the clever bit. Once your app is up and running your phone becomes your entrance and room key. The lifts ate code locked so you open your app and hold your phone to the reader on the lift and it unlocks. Same process to gain access to your room. The room was immaculately clean and well presented with all the things you would expect from a modern hotel. There was also a storeroom on our floor, I assume there is one on each floor. This was available and had all the spare things you may need, even down to toothbrushs  flannels, vanity packs, towels even extra glasses and also milk, sugar etc. A sign was put up asking guests to help themselves to anything they needed but to be considerate and remember that other guests my need things also. There was also spare toilet roll available in there too. Another room was a recycling room with every recycling bin you could imagine. We thought this was a very nice touch and most useful. Entrance was through the attached restaurant during opening hours and through a side door after hours. The restaurant was open until around 1am but to be honest we hardly heard any noise from it at all. We stayed for 2 nights during a tour of Scandinavia and could not find any faults with the room at all. There was one fault that was the lift used after hours was broken on our visit but we luckily found the other one. Out of hours access includes a small flight of stairs so I couldn&#39;t comment on wheelchair access. This may be available elsewhere in the property.

Of course their responsibilities ends and it&#39;s the financial institution problem now. They need to get another way like taking cash and giving it right back when you check out. Regardless, I don&#39;t have money to be handing out at these hotels. I&#39;ve had deposits up to $150.00 and the lowest was $75.00.

Fruit juice, cereals, toast and coffee&#47;tea were also available and brought to the table. Outside seating was provided at the front of the building.\n",

The staff went above and beyond everytime even with small things like asking about the nearest pharmacy, they would print a map and draw the directions for us. The rooms were beautiful, we were able to get a room on the 10th floor that had stunning views over the city of Guadalajara. We had a few injuries and family members who required wheelchairs and the hotel let us borrow the wheelchair our entire trip. Breakfast had fresh fruit and eggs and beans and an assortment of other delicious veggies and goodies and was great for the price each morning! The pool is quite small however it was still fun to sit in for a while and the gym is very nice and has great equipment for use! Bathrooms are so spacious and have hairdryers, lotion, shampoo, razor etc! It was about 15 min from downtown Guadalajara but you can walk around the hotel down a few streets and find a whole strip of restaurants and ice cream shops and parks to relax at.

I&#39;d like to give a special thank you to the women in staff with the name &quot;Audrone&quot; She was really caring and helpful.

The house keeping team also did a great job as they ensured that the premises was clean and pleasant at all times. I was also greeted with great care of my partner who is disabled and is in a wheelchair.  Help from all of the staff made my life feel much easier as accessibly for us is a very big thing and determines places we go and places we don&#39;t. Our room was on the 7th floor and a great panoramic view of Vilnius was seen which was stunning and only left good memories, Looking forward to revisiting thing place in the future.\n",

The cleaners keep the hotel grounds and rooms immaculate. My mother and I have some mobility issues and even though our rooms were up stairs, the stair wells are very well lit and the stairs and shallow with a very sturdy hand rail. The room had two bedrooms with large king size beds, with ensuites.  our room had an addition single bed for our 5year old.  Both bedrooms had air conditioning.  The balcony area had a table and four chairs and drying lines.  I would have a coffee there in the morning. The ground floor from reception to the beach bar, restaurant, beach bar is completely flat, great for thoses who require walking aids or a wheelchair.  to get onto the beach there are a couple of steps down onto the sand, again the steps are shallow and if you do require additional assistance the staff are very happy to help!

      "Negative: There is only one entrance comprised of an automated revolving door (too small if you&#39;re accompanied by small children so you risk being slammed) and a regular door on the side, wide enough to accommodate a buggy or wheelchair but woefully without any automation which means you&#39;d have to manually pull the door wide open and hold it to be able to enter. For this reason access not great. The bar and restaurant looked sus. Sometimes a dubious gutter smell emanated from the basement floor. The spa was closed which was disappointing. The hallway carpet on the 6th floor had bleach marks over what seemed to be old accident (vomit etc) stains, not pleasant to look at. We were travelling with our two dogs. Upon arrival (late in the evening) we were told that there would be a pet fee of €12&#47;dog&#47;day which we didn&#39;t have time to discuss. Upon check out (8 am 34 hours later) we were asked to pay for 2 full days and when asked how the charge was justified the person at the desk got very stroppy with me, although all I wanted to understand was what it was for.

      "Negative: Apparently the 3rd party interface with Booking.com and Hampton Inn is problematic.  I changed our dates THREE MONTHS BEFORE our trip, and received confirmation of the change.  Upon arriving at the hotel, we only had ONE room instead of two, and the handicapped accessible room was booked as a &quot;hearing accessible&quot; room.  Booking.com apparently does not discriminate between TYPES of handicapped rooms in the system.      We had to change rooms on day 2, and we also had to make a lot of adjustments of charges.  All in all, very frustrating.\n",

      "Positive: The property is surrounded by trees and beautiful views.  They have an on-site restaurant and room service.  I have mobility issues so they juggled around a lot of rooms to be able to put me in the access room.  If they didn’t move me I would not have been able to stay there as there are no lifts.  The access room met my needs and meant I was able to enjoy my stay.  I was told I wouldn’t be able to use my wheelchair to get to the room as one ramp was too steep.  That wasn’t the case.  I could have easily used my power assist wheelchair to go down the ramp and to the room.  Unfortunately I left it behind as it was suggested the ramp was too steep for a wheelchair.  If you use a manual wheelchair and can’t walk at all, it means when you leave the only way out is back up the ramp.  So you would need someone strong to push you back up the ramp.  I’m not sure how easy it is to access the restaurant with a wheelchair as I didn’t go to it.  There is a ramp to reception but then I saw 2 steps up and so didn’t go any further.  In saying that I didn’t ask about alternate access to the restaurant so I suggest calling ahead.  The staff were helpful.\n",
      "Negative: Nothing I didn’t like about the property.  Just a suggestion - it would be nice to have had a small table on the balcony with the 2 chairs.  Even if there was a small fold up one left inside that you could take out.  So lovely to sit on the balcony and take in the views.\n",

As an interest, the lift only services the first floor.  The location was exceptionally good, right in the centre of town. There are two disability parking bays outside the hotel. Blue badge holders do not have a time limit and parking is free. We occupied one of the spaces for the duration of our stay which was four nights.  Our room was large enough to accommodate my wheelchair without it being in the way when not in use, also the walk-in shower and bathroom were large and roomy. There is a pull-cord system in place in case of emergencies and various rails around the loo and shower. The only thing I would say was that it is inconvenient is the size of the wash hand basin  is tiny and a tad useless if I must be honest. I tended to get more water on me than in the bowl.

      "Positive: I booked Loly Boutique Hotel while on our walk there for 5 nights after a scary misadventure at our prior B&amp;B booking while jet lagged from travelling all night. I was looking for a nearby hotel in Trastevere with a 24 hour front desk staff that seemed comfortable and safe for my elder mom (her first trip to Europe) and I. We got what we needed and more.  The staff were exceptional: from excellent restaurant and cafe suggestions, enthusiasm facilitating transportation requests and reservations, Italian wine knowledge and tastings at the bar, and overall welcoming demeanor, they made a lasting positive impression after our initial travel plans had gone sideways. This smaller boutique hotel has a community-like feel and we tremendously enjoyed our stay here.  The breakfast was delicious with many options, from freshly baked sweets, to salad, salumi, insalata, eggs, bacon, pancakes, and more. Again, the staff were amazing. They made and effort to learn our names and had our coffee and wine preferences memorized by the third day.  The location is unbeatable. Quiet on the edge of the hip foodie community of Trastevere so you can sleep without ambulance sirens or drunkards keeping you up, but close enough to walk to all the key sights (or a quick taxi away) and food stops. Literally around the corner from Fatamorgana, (a food tour hot spot of gelato places), and a short run to the Tiber River to log some stress free miles for other runners like myself.  The showers and bathroom were great, the balcony and chairs a nice touch (a little cool outside, so we skipped on that), and the bar&#47;lounge was a great place to put your feet up and relax after a long day with some wine (with included snacks).  Our room appeared entirely wheelchair accessible except for our balcony, if that&#39;s important for you. The shower could be rolled into (glass folding doors that could be stowed completely for access) and included a shower seat, rain head, and wand.\n",
      "Negative: Two minor things:  1) The thermostat was hard to understand, and the room was sometimes a bit cold, but that never interrupted our sleep and the bath robes provided were enough for extra warmth for us (we visited in mid March).   2) Sometimes it took a little while for housekeeping to get to our room, but I suspect the housekeepers were quite busy with many people checking out that day, and we returned from our day in the early afternoon.

We were upgraded to the most fabulous room I have ever stayed in thanks to the lovely young lady who checked I&#39;d in at the beautiful hotel and I believe her name started with an R. I feel bad because I have not been able to find the card that I asked her to write her name on. She was wonderful!   Usman took our luggage to the room and was amazing! He told us the history of the hotel and later when at the bar (he was giving the lovely Audriana, bartender extraordinaire, a break). Usman explained that where we were sitting was a stage and showed us where the band sat. I felt like I was talking to a welcoming friend, rather than hotel staff. Usman was extremely personable and made sure we were comfortable and had what we needed. The hotel stopped serving dinner, however, he told us about restaurants close by. The one we chose, Momma Mia was awesome and just around the corner.   A rather rude, spoiled young teen came in with her father and Usman treated them both with utmost kindness. While I was shocked at her behavior (we were seated where she wanted to sit), he completely ignored her and showed only grace.  Another wonderful gentleman helped us with our luggage to the Uber and literally ran to help us. I cannot remember his name. He was tall and I believe it started with an A, but I could be wrong. I just know I couldn&#39;t pronounce it.  The staff was awesome starting with the wonderful young lady who check this in and upgraded us. I have to say that Usman and Audriana were Superstars! As well as the young lady who checked us in. I will get back when I find out their names.  The beds and pillows were super comfy as well as the entire room which was huge!

They also would not let us check out one hour later and we’re told no. We asked about elevators from the second floor down to the swimming pool and we were told by two employees that there were none but we did end up finding them because there was a guest in a wheelchair so we knew there had to be one.  We each got 80 minute massages and the spa was unorganized and the massages were subpar compared to other spas we have been at in Cabo.\n",

The bathroom was not made very functional for a wheelchair. The toilet was not in a good spot.  The elevator was not working on the floor we were staying on Saturday. You could go from the 2nd floor to the first floor. But going up the elevator would not stop at the 2 nd floor therefore I could not get out of my room after we came in about 3:00. My family did not want to leave me in the room. I am in a wheelchair so therefore could not walk down the stairs from the 3rd floor to the 2nd floor.

      "Negative: Throughout our 3 night stay, only one out of two lifts was working which led to long queues. I&#39;m assuming that there isn&#39;t a service lift in the hotel because staff and cleaners were forced to use it as well. The bar, although a nice social space, had only one draught beer and one cider on tap for the duration of our stay. There is a nice area at reception to sit but unfortunately it was always spoiled by cigarette smoke blowing in from outside where smokers gathered seemingly constantly. This must be very unpleasant for receptionists in their work environment. On our second night, there was an extremely noisy event on the first floor with music so loud it made the bed shake! (We had a 3rd floor room, about as far away from the party as you could get) It did finish at midnight, thank goodness but there is no way you could sleep through it.  Breakfast was adequate but somewhat pricy, I thought.  If you are a wheelchair user, or have mobility problems, please check the hotel layout. There were stairs up and down once you got out of the lift on the 3rd floor.  Sadly, I feel that this could be a great hotel, these issues I&#39;ve mentioned could be easily sorted with a bit of money spent and considerations made for all guests.\n",

This is far superior, with some wheelchair access and very pleasant staff, available 24&#47;7.  5 mins max walk from Central Station (very slight uphill), 10 mins walk from Haymarket bus and metro stations, 10 mins from the National express coach station and 5 mins slight down hill from monument metro station.  Plenty of sockets in rooms near beds. PC available in longue. Free WiFi is quite good and reaches the 1sy floor where I stayed. Top bunks have pockets for phones etc. Everywhere is nice and warm. Nicely decorated and clean. Showers and toilets were kept spotless by staff and the kitchen was cleaned by guests. Plenty of cutlery plates, glasses Pam&#39;s and basic utensils hand and tea towels available. Plenty of room for cooking and cleaning up. A very cheap laundry facility available. £1 per wash.

      "Positive: Greeting and care were exceptional from staff. Location was amazing for men but for women it is quite a walk to the women&#39;s entrances which I knew before booking. The facilities are amazing, just was a little concerned with the locks on the doors being damaged or not working properly, I was traveling with my 6 kids and had three rooms. I brought extra portable hotel locks that you buy on Amazon just in case there were issues with door locks, so these came in handy. I would recommend getting them no matter where you are traveling too or what hotel you book. Walk to the courtyard of the Haram was literally just across the street. If you have a wheelchair though, the street ramps are either broken or difficult to navigate, so it requires a bit more work to get across without the person in the wheelchair needing to get out or be lifted in the chair over bumps or curbs. But not too difficult. The buffet had a ton of choice and was always fresh. However, would have liked to see a few more traditional hot options like breakfast sausage and hash browns. The room service was excellent and affordable. Not too many options, but those that were available were quite good and good serving sizes that could be shared.\n",

They were able to switch us to a downstairs room each time. However, it is . Very nerve-racking, having to fear that we end  up with no room because no downstairs is available. We always book weeks in advance, and it should not be a problem to accommodate a disabled guest. The owner is on the rude site, but the lady that works the reception when he is off very nice.

When we asked, they told us that cleaning service had an extra charge, something that was not mentioned upon reservation or check in.  We were given a room that was accessible for guests in wheelchair, although we didn’t need that and again wasn’t mentioned in reservation. The problem was that the bathroom was different than the one we had seen, it had no bath tub or specific shower space, we had to take a bath actually on the bathroom floor, no glass, curtain, bathtub, anything. It was really inconvenient and resulted in making a mess every time we had a shower and walking in the wet bathroom floor. Moreover there was no waste bin in the bathroom.  It wasn’t a cheap room nor a hostel to lack basic facilities.\n",

Spending 15 minutes on hold when you are sitting at the gate to get in is unacceptable. However, the staff was gracious and comped the $45 parking fee for the first night due to the inconvenience.  Our first room had no blackout curtain (which we did not discover until it was time for our little children to go to bed). We tried to sleep anyway, and our little ones woke up at all hours because of the light coming in.

      "Positive: When we arrived our originally allocated room was changed. The room was upstairs. My friend had trouble negotiating the stairs. The receptionist noted this and upgraded us to a ground level disability room.\n",
      "Negative: The room originally booked room, 23 was swapped for room 3 when we arrived. Room 3 had only a small table and one chair, yet two people were to be accommodated. It was also quite small.     The stairs to get to the room were a trial - a lift is desperately needed to allow people to get to the second level with their luggage easily, and also for health and safety reasons. Someone frail falling down the stairs would be a catastrophe. My friend was unable to nogotiate the stairs easily, which the receptionist noted. She upgraded us to room 101, a disability unit, at no charge.    The disability room had a wide range of appliances, easy parking and easy access.     Some of the negatives about the room were:   - the large gap underneath the entry&#47; exit door which allowed cold air to rush in.  - the sink in the living room which had the tap on the right hand side. Most people would operate the tape from the left hand side.  - the lack of a shower curtain or partition between the shower and the toilet. Attempting to use the shower meant that the toilet became wet and the rest of the bathroom was flooded. A 1200 X 1200mm curtain rail could easily be fitted with a weighted shower curtain. This would not interfere with wheelchair access.   - poor silicone sealing at the base of the bathroom walls which allows water to access the floor tiles.  - the TV was effectively non-operational because of poor signal strength - it needs an antenna amplifier. Thank goodness we took a radio.    We had a dinner at the hotel on the night we arrived which was acceptable. However when we went for lunch the next day, the menus were not readily available and the hamburger &quot;special&quot; had sold out. Service appeared to be slow, so we abandoned the hotel dining room for the Blue Seal cafe. We ate at venues other than the hotel thereafter.\n",

We were exhausted with the long drive after work, hot weather and Umrah. He extended our check out time and we had a full rest before we left for another long drive back home to Madinah.   We requested a room upgrade and the reception staff was kind enough to do the same for us for the same price.  The house keeping staff Mr Dawood, and Mr Jalees were too helpful. They have been always available for anything needed in the room like extra water, coffee sachets, extra towels and pillows etc. This is not the first time we stayed in this hotel and as usual the entire staff tried their best to make us feel at home. Thank you every one.   Availability of the wheelchair at the hotel was another plus for our aunty who couldn&#39;t walk for long. The lifts are not crowded and congested. Shuttle available very frequently to haram. All the facilities near by, the barber shop is within the hotel campus. Would recommend to others for sure. Walking to haram is not too long if the weather is good and the Gerwal entrance of the Haram extension area is open. This time it was closed so it took long to walk from the shuttle drop point to haram.  The breakfast was available for 20 SAR&#47; head and it was good for the price.\n",

The staff were amazing, they were really helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them, they even opened the bar so we could have a nightcap.  The main building isn&#39;t wheelchair accessible but the chalets are as long as you can walk a little bit and fold your chair. Mine doesn&#39;t fold so hubby had to put it in the car.

The mini bar in the room contains free soft drinks and chocolate bars. Bottled water is also free and replenished daily. Service was excellent. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I had to borrow or hire a wheelchair for my elderly mum who cannot walk. Hotel was able to provide one free of charge.

      "Negative: The color scheme in the newly renovated hotel is not my taste! I was very disappointed. It has the same dark colour scheme as the G Hotel Kelawei. For a 5-star hotel, everything or every room in the hotel is so dark! The place looks dull and boring. The rooms or corridor could do with some brightly coloured paintings or pictures. It will be useful to add mirrors too in the lifts. The reception lobby is now on the 3rd floor. It used to be on the spacious ground floor. The lighting in the bathroom is too dim for my wife to do her makeup.\n",

They put in a curtain when we requested as well. Good extras like shampoo&#47;gels&#47;coffee&#47;tea.  They also shared additional detergent and an iron&#47;board when we told them we really needed to use the washer&#47;dryer, which worked very well! And of course location was superb. We were a few steps away from everything, including a grocery, cafes, shopping, the cathedral (for Sunday mass), the Picasso Museum as well as the marina&#47;beach.

Ground floor rooms easy to access with the wheelchair, ramp down long but not too steep. Shutters on the outside of the rooms meant total blackout inside. Staff incredibly helpful at every opportunity. We booked dinner on day of arrival, and when we came up to eat, a table for 4 had been assigned for the 3 of us, with one chair already removed to account for the wheelchair - v impressed. Staff very respectful and went out of their way to support us, strong levels of English across the board.\n",

It is difficult to see the entrance to the drive, the curbs are not dipped so there is a bump to drive in and down, and if you miss the turning in, there is a fair amount of driving around the block to try again. The Accueil &#47; Restaurant is a separate building close to the road, the rooms are further down, which was a little difficult with a wheelchair.\n",

There is one flight of stairs to get to the tiny lift which is not ideal for heavy luggage, elderly with wheely walker or prams. Do not book if you travel with a person in a wheelchair! No aircon which was expected but also no fly screens on any windows so if you travel in summer you are either very sweaty or get eaten by mosquitoes 😉 Lots of homeless people between the train station and hotel but they didn&#39;t bother us.

The whole place looked more than acceptable in terms of upkeep and cleanliness. I certainly would not rule it out as an option again.\n",

The shower was impossible to use because there was no wheelchair access to the room so I couldn&#39;t transfer to a shower chair.   Also the toilet could have had a grab rail to make it easier.

Very safe neighborhood, not noisy during night. Most probably they have converted a residential building into a hotel, the decoration was a mixture of rustic and modern touches. Our room (Gabrielle) was extremely spacious with a very big bathroom. We were 3 girls and were able to fit in the closet and use the room very conveniently. Simona was super super nice and kind. I reached out to her to make bookings and reservations for restaurants in advance and helped a lot for the arrangements. When we arrived she recommended several places and venues, that was super helpful. She even suggested Instagramable spots. They also have a restaurant near Pantheon and give discount to hotel guests. I also had a minor health condition and she was extremely helpful and attentive. Very pleasant stay with great hospitality. I will definitely stay there when visiting Rome again.\n",

The internal door in this corridor is so loud, it makes room 1 shake. The door bangs loudly from early a.m. to midnight most days of the week. It can be very disruptive.

The first evening they didn&#39;t have 2 of the meals we wanted from the menu, but the second time they had everything. The property staff was very kind and helpful, especially the guys at the swimming pool. The place is peaceful, quiet (depending on the neighbors), pretty, and maintained. Saw the people&#39;s dogs were happy. The swimming pool was heated and clean. The hot tub was big enough and was checked every day by the staff if the water was good.\n",
      "Negative: Not enough things for disabled people. Asked for a ramp for our wheelchair so could get easier to the shalet but was not available. The cabin shower was sooooo small. There was no way for a disabled person to get inside, even though I was not disabled, to get to the shower, I had to squeeze like through a hole in a fence. The beds, especially the single beds, were so narrow and light that if you touched them lightly, they would move.   With over 11 million disabled people in Britain, the owners of Medmerry Park can think about some changes to some of the chalets to make them more accessible and comfortable for disabled guests. Walking showers, ramps for the chalet, and a ramp for disabled people in the swimming pool will be good.\n",

It is right on the Camino de Santiago walking path, so convenient to stay if you are doing that.  They served breakfast (including eggs) starting at 7:30 am, and they served dinner also starting at 7:30 pm, which was before most nearby restaurants.

The distance between the bed and the furniture- desk, table, dresser was a little too narrow for me to get my chair through. I’m f I were traveling alone I wouldn’t have been able to get to the bathroom. Also, the shower is a rolling and there’s a drain in the shower and another in the middle of the bathroom. The floor gets very wet and makes transferring from the shower bench to the wheelchair a little difficult.

The rooms it’s self was fine for him but  shower was an issue as there was a step up to the cubicle with a narrow opening on the door which meant he couldn’t use the  shower . I’m around 5’8 and the shower rail didn’t go over my head so I couldn’t wash my hair.   Access to the main hotel is up a flight of steps at the front of the building and we were told that we could have access to the car park at the rear to gain access to the hotel. That was fine however the car park is exceptionally small with one disabled parking space which really is not big enough for people to get in and out of their car- I don’t know what would happen if there was more than one disabled person using the hotel ?

The resort required a lot of walking via stairs, especially to visit the pool, spa, gym, or to go down to the beach. These amenities were not accessible via elevator.

Lift in fact still not fixed two days later. I would have expected better response than we got and we also witnessed another guest who was a wheelchair user having great difficulty with stairs in absence of a working lift.

You can hear people moving around in other rooms too. You will need to climb up a steep stair to your room at 2nd storey. I will not recommend if you have small children or wheelchair bounded. The windows are not able to close completely which leads to having mosquito to fly in too. I travelled with a 7 year old boy and he might have caused some of these noise to other guests throughout our stay :(    However the host only inform us via whatsapp upon our arrival that soundproof isn&#39;t very good as this is a heritage building.

I had to hold it with one hand to get myself wet, but had to let it dangle to wash my hair and body, which then resulted in a &quot;flooding&quot; of the bathroom floor.  We did as if they could change rooms for us, which they did.  The staff gave us a King Suite room, which was very nice.  But the maintenance of the place is wanting.  Also, they haven&#39;t been serving breakfast since COVID began. COVID has been over for about 2 years now and they still are not serving breakfast, but advertise that they do and are charging the same rates as if they were still serving breakfast.

Asked if there was a place for doggie do&#39;s as I had put them in our car. Lady said put them in her rubbish bag she will be dumping soon. Should you have outside rubbish bin? Really appreciated that even though in a plastic bag the thought of bringing all the way back home not so encouraging.   The Staff allowed sister to swap rooms because access to the toilet was NO GOOD with a wheel chair and as it was neither was ours.

      "Positive: The room was quiet and the bed was super comfortable. Climate controls worked well. Very nice room super close to major subway stops for connections to work in Manhattan, Queens and beyond.  What I liked the most was the Universal Design in the room.  The shower was a walk-in&#47;roll-in. The toilet was higher than usual. It was not a specific room for wheelchair users, but a person with a disability could be accommodated well by it. The room also is great for those who are aging and need easy access.  The shower had some of the greatest water pressure that I&#39;ve enjoyed on the road -- and it was super warm. It had a temperature gauge to let you know not to make it too hot.  The maid service was wonderful. I did not want my bed made, as I make it in a special way.  But I did want fresh towels, more coffee&#47;creamer for the machine in the room, etc.  That was done perfectly and unobtrusively.  The same building has a large grocery in it. A tad pricey, though it is New York. I bought tons of fresh fruit and multigrain cereal, chilled the milk in my fridge and had a low fat breakfast in the room -- to save calories and money.  I would return.\n",
      "Negative: The woman who checked me in was surely.  She should not work in hospitality.  I know the difference between gruff New Yorkers and someone who is not good to work with.  I emailed a month ahead and wanted to check in 90 minutes early.  It was not a big event week and hotel was not full.  But she whined and complained and said I&#39;d be in an adjoining room and that was a problem if the people next door tried to enter my room.  The next day, I asked for an extra flat sheet and some additional coffee packets from the in-room coffee maker. She rolled her eyes and scowled like I had asked her if I could stay a month for free.  I hope management matches my check in to the person who processes me and retrains her.  She literally cost this property the difference from an 8 star to 10 star review on a one to 10.\n",

      "Positive: The overall first impression was that we chose a decent location in a safe area near the college. Based on my travel experience, the value was a little bit overpriced, and with a week&#39;s stay, normally I would have received several perks and a substantial discount. The hotel was affordable and private but I did see other locations that I will keep my eyes on for our next visit in the future. Having a potential business in the area, I suspect that I might be in the area more often.    The building was in good repair and had no unpleasant odor. The room seemed freshly remodeled and painted with lovely wall hangings. The beds were in good condition and the bedding spotless. The suite sofa-sleeper was adequate but not overall comfortable versus similar accommodations in the area. Considering that we were in town for a weeklong conference at Lee University, I was surprised at how few people stayed on this property. Because of the lack of being overly full, we had minimal noise during the night and felt comfortable getting rest without disruption. The only time we had to ask for the noise levels to be addressed, the staff took care of it without further issues.    The policy of this hotel was that room services were provided every three days. For my family, I would say this was not exactly the best idea and felt like we needed to fend for ourselves by getting towels and toiletries often. The toilet paper quality was fine but the roll size was in question. My suggestion would be a different brand to provide a better value because, at home, my family would have used maybe 2 rolls at the same time we used 7 at the hotel because they were small.\n",
      "Negative: The elevator being out of service was an immediate issue and it was not resolved during the week we stayed. I am disabled as was the lady that I reserved the other room for and we were unable to climb stairs. Luckily we were both given rooms on the bottom floor unlike originally planned. I would say that it was our luck that we had canceled our third room for a wheelchair-bound person because the property would not have been acceptable to her.    The AC system was not efficient or capable of serving the entire room. The suite was like a sauna without venting for any comfort. The restroom was poorly designed, tight, and unventilated. The toilet was wedged between a wall and the tub with no room to sit properly and with no circulation vent, it allowed human stink to linger for everyone. Lack of privacy was also a factor as entry to the restroom had no door and the suite had to disturb the sleeping area to gain access. The hair dryer did not work but my girls brought their own to use. The doors drag the carpet and are hard to open &amp; close which over time is going to ruin the carpet. It seemed like the flooring under the carpet was uneven which will cause issues for carpet replacement sooner than needed.    At checkout, I was disturbed when my bill was overcharged by over $200. Initially, I was told that the tax rate had increased but I disproved that being the issue. We had to endure a long process of explaining and showing my confirmed booking before finally making some adjustments. There were two adults, a 17 &amp; 16-year-old for the room that slept six and the website clearly states that children under 18 stay free with each adult. The manager did make an adjustment but I felt like this was not handled in the best way. In all my years of using Booking or similar services, this is the first time I have ever had problems with pricing being an issue.\n",

I passed on showers during our stay.  - Needs a cady for shampoo and soap in the shower.  - Desperately needs handrails on all stair locations - people with disabilities or stability issues, please note.  - Light in one bedroom kept coming on during the night - is it a motion detector switch?  - The ladder in the plunge pool should have steps.

He then led us to the apartment and on our way there he recommended us some interesting pubs, restaurants and cafés (we visited some of them and they were really great).     As for the apartment, it was clean, very nice-looking, and actually nicely accessible for a wheelchair user. I was very happy that in one of the bedrooms there was a lot of space for me to turn around without worrying about hitting the walls. The en-suite bathroom was rather narrow, but I managed to work things through. The bath is not really accessible for disabled people but I was warned about that and I was there only for one night so it didn&#39;t matter.

However,when I book hotel parking i expect the parking to be in the hotel or very close. I do not want to spend that much time just to take my car and put the luggage on it!and especially when I travel with someone with disabilities!   one more thing : there is a ’troskel’ on the way to get in the bathroom but there is not on the way out from the bathroom, making it difficult when you use wheelchair.

      "Positive: Staying at Yumbo is not like staying in a commercial hotel...you stay with Ecuadorian family, in their home...the owners live there, they clean, they responded to the special needs of their guesses. Lots of live plants are everywhere. Lots of sun light shines through the skylights that provide sunlight and fresh air to each of four floors of what was once a large mansion home at least two centures ago.  Guesses have kitchen privileges, but the kitchen is small, but fully furnished with everything needed to prepare a full meal. Across from the kitchen  is dining room with TV...it has windows open to sunlight and fresh air.  The bathroom in rooms has a good shower that produces lots of hot water even for a long shower.. There is a single-step-up to reach the bathroom floor, but I had no trouble  making the one step with use of my cane.  There are two streight connected stairways that must be managed to reach the reception booth. Staff Iis always available provide help that will allow a person who uses a wheelchair to gain safe entry to the Yumbo guess revieption area. There are four first floor rooms, if the Yumbo guests uses a wheelchair  I  spent two rewarding months at Yumbo...what I mean by rewarding is guesses from all-over-the World of all ages come to Yumbo...these Workfwide guesses can become short-term, even long-term friends.  One last benefit, guesses who stay one-night...get FREE baggage storage while  a is away for a month or so traveling elsewjere.  Yumbo is a Five Star Ecuadorean  Experience...you will telll friends about...  The location is a bargain ...room rents are very low...Yumbo is half-a-block from the main street of the heart of the World Historic Site.. Old Quito has been well preserved...security is very present...the Presidentual Palace  is a short walk...the streets in the Histortic area is wheelchair friendly...two of the four+ Cathedrals are wheelchair friendly...\n",

Also, as you walk out of the hotel, all the taxis are there which is great if you want to pick up a taxi but not great breathing in the diesel fumes as you walk towards the Masjid!

The concierge staff really helped us make the most of our stay and arranged as much as we wanted. The staff in general were so lovely - they got the perfect balance between being attentive yet not overbearing. The resort is quite big but there was always an electric buggy available within minutes to transport you around. The lifeguards at the pool were very helpful and covered the beach and the communal pool.\n",

We had requested a wheelchair accessible room, which we were very pleased with.  The room was spacious enough for my husband to move around with his wheelchair; the bathroom was large and had a nice vanity, grab bars by the toilet and a tub with a fold-down shower chair and adjustable hand-held shower head.  (I mention all these details for travelers with disabilities... sometimes it is difficult to determine when booking if an accessible room is going to meet your needs).

The hotel is around the corner and up the hill from the train station.  If you are relying on getting here via train, this location is perfect.  Get the breakfast at the hotel- there aren&#39;t many options in town (other than the CoOp not much is open in the morning).\n",
      "Negative: Perhaps the fact that this hotel is not disabled accessible is mentioned on Booking.com but somehow I missed it.  My mother was traveling with a wheelchair due to limited mobility.  I did not realise that there wasn&#39;t a lift.  She had to climb two flights of stairs.  I felt just awful about it.  If I had noticed I would have reserved a room on the first floor.  The hotel was full, all those rooms were gone when I realised the situation.  If you are severely disabled it will not be possible to stay here.  A person could get caught out very easily if they weren&#39;t aware of the situation.\n",

It is an ideal place as a bed-and-breakfast, but don&#39;t plan to spend much time in the bedroom, because it is tiny.  There are common areas - a living room and a balcony.  No breakfast per se. There is a kitchen available to use. Maybe there was breakfast cereal or bread to toast, but we didn&#39;t utilise the kitchen.\n",

The communal area had nice high tables and chairs with shared small fridge, stove and other cutlery. One could also grab more toilet paper, litter bags, amenities and more as needed. The decoration was quite welcoming and cozy too! Location wise, walking around at night might feel a bit suspicious or not so secure, but during the day it&#39;s quite lively and has Metro, Tram and Bus stops all super close. It&#39;s also relatively easy to walk to and from the main train station, Colosseum, Roman Forum, etc.\n",
      "Negative: They usually give the access of the main entrance and the apartment complex entrance through an app a few hours before your check in, but seemingly I was the unlucky only case where that was automatically revoked&#47;expired still during the same day of the check in. We had to do a late (22:45) check in, so not sure if that was the reason. It took a while but the staff helped by setting up a new access. There is also an elevator in the building which is really small (barely fits one or two people, let alone a wheelchair) but the pushchair somehow got in. The elevator calling light also wants turning on, so one couldn&#39;t be sure the elevator was actually working, although this problem is not probably something easily fixable by the Suites as the building is shared with other businesses.\n",

There are a couple small fixes that could make it really useful- the telephone to call the front desk needs to be moved down so a wheelchair user could reach it, as do the shampoo etc bottles in the shower.

Location is central but with that comes a lot of noise disturbance,Depending on where your situated on the complex. Noise from bars&#47;streets which are situated near by the complex. Also the walls must be paper thin as you can hear everything, if you’ve an apartment above yours you can hear footsteps,banging which isn’t great when trying to sleep at night. We could even hear someone snoring from there room next door. There’s a lot of steps depending on where your room is, so you’re dragging suitcases and luggage up a lot of stairs to find your room.

The furniture needs to be updated which would give so much more space for manouvering around.  Also carpeting is very difficult for &#39;transfers&#39; from chair to bed and vice versa, laminate flooring would completely alter this situation.   The bathroom also needs a rethink again to be more space aware for wheelchairs users.

My partner and I don&#39;t mind walking long distance for things, but the apartment was so close to everything.  It was very clean on entering, we had requested and earlier check-in and the host Ana was more than accommodating having met us there, she changed the battery in the safe there and then when we entered the apartment and was always a phone call away.  We had tried to request a later check-out as our transfer was picking us up at 17:20 and check-out was at 10:00, this wasn&#39;t possible as someone else was checking in at 12:00 (which is understandable) however we were able to leave our luggage in a safe place and had a front door access key to get back into the main building to collect them closer to the transfer window.  My partner and I try to visit Nerja every year, normally we stay in the Mena Plaza Hotel (which is also a brilliant hotel) and is directly across from the apartment but staying in this apartment was a first it has completely changed our outlook on visiting and we may even return to the same apartment in the future.  It&#39;s a spacious apartment, the furniture was very comfortable, the shower had very good water pressure and was very easy to use.  We were able to bring a firestick and plug it into the TV and watch Disney+ and Netflix, there was plenty of outlets that we could plug devices into.  There was cutlery, plates, bowls, glasses, chopping board, hairdryer, AC in living area and bedroom, dining table with 4 chairs and a information document regarding the apartment and contact info for Ana.

The balcony didn&#39;t have any table or chairs as it wasn&#39;t that big to accommodate this, but it was big enough for 2 people to stand out.  In some cases we could hear the people in the apartment next to us and above us, walls are a little thin.

When the shower was tried again later on in the second day, the shower magically warmed up.    We felt a bit fobbed off when all we wanted was a shower after travelling all day.

      "Positive: I initially chose the MAF following reviews posted online. I knew it was located in the heart of Haarlem, a few minutes from St. Bavo&#39;s Cathedral. I knew the building is historical and is undergoing some renovation, but this did in no way impact my use and enjoyment of the room. If &quot;decadent luxury&quot; and a &quot;taste for the past&quot; are your cup of tea, this boutique hotel totally brings it and delivers it. I enjoyed the location, the fully renovated bathrooms (I did get a room with a bathtub and it was fabulous). The staff I interacted with directly were very helpful, and always polite. I did ask for a little bit of disinfectant just to make sure, in my own obsessive way, that I scrub the bathtub myself a few minutes before jumping in, and they immediately helped without any other comments. I asked everyday for coffee creamer and I did order lunch once which was immediately delivered to my room. So all the people I met were wonderful. Even in situations where I needed extra help or support, they offered their sympathy and did their best to try to find a solution for me. I thank them for that.\n",
      "Negative: The stairs are not pleasant, but they are part of the Dutch way of life so be prepared for extra work outs (cardio) while going into and out of your room. To the best of my knowledge, the hotel is not wheelchair-accessible. And it will be tough on anyone who cannot comfortably climb 50-100 stairs at a minimum per day (assuming you go in&#47;out of your room a couple of times per day). The only other thing to signal is that my room had only 1 window, and therefore the air could not circulate properly. The staff kept a window permanently open, and there are electrical fans, but during the night, when one might not want to sleep with the fan turned on, and even right before a storm, there is a heavy humid hotness permeating the air. It might feel better to be outside. Maybe it depends also on room position and floor level. But this is something to be considered on the long term, perhaps for future modifications for the hotel. Not everybody can keep a fan turned on for too long, if they suffer from sinusitis or other such affections.\n",

This room was way at the top (attic room) having to climb three flights of very narrow stairs, with your suitcase very difficult and unsafe for some.  This part of the building does not have a lift.  We asked if we could move to another room, which they offered us room 1, on the ground.  This was more suited for wheelchair users, so the whb in bathroom lower, and had a level access shower, but not a problem..  A small shelf for placing your bathroom items would be ideal. The bathroom very cold as there was no heat, so the left door opened for heat to travel from bedroom to the bathroom. (unless I didn&#39;t see the heating)  The room was near the fire exit door, so we experienced the banging of door, early morning for deliveries (or whatever it was) and smokers standing by window,  so cigarette smell going through window into room, window not sealed properly and very drafty... ..  The room is very clean though 😊  **So when booking check floor level**  Evening meals were excellent, but check when ordering steak, there is a £10 supplement to be paid, which I did not notice, on the menu, as it was in yellow and I have trouble seeing certain colours, this payment was not mentioned on the first night when steak was ordered, but had to pay on the second night....so read menu carefully if staying half board.\n",

I had made clear I was traveling with my elderly mother, who is in a wheelchair, so it seemed not terribly thoughtful to put us in rooms so far from where breakfast was served. Also, breakfast is served quite early, and I wanted to let my 89 year old mother sleep in. She usually only has tea and toast in the morning, so she opted to stay in bed, and we said we would bring her back some tea. When we got to the dining room, they asked where the 5th member of our party was. I explained that she was 89 and sleeping in, so I would just bring her back some tea. The woman at the dining room quite abruptly made clear that I couldn&#39;t take food from the dining room back to another guest, and if I wanted to take my mom tea, they would have to charge me for it. We never did take back tea. We went out for tea with mom afterward.

But the problem was that when someone requested a wheelchair-accessible room, they asked me to shift rooms. I don&#39;t think any hotel, especially a 5-star rated hotel, should inconvenience guests by shuttling them between rooms like this. This was highly unprofessional. Special-needs rooms should be left empty so that guests aren&#39;t bothered during their stay.  2. The second room I was booked into had a dirty bathroom. The toilet was clearly used, not cleaned, not flushed and smelled badly. I also noticed that the tissues in the tissue box looked like they were stuffed back in after too many had been pulled out by the previous occupant. When I called housekeeping, they said the bathroom had been cleaned and I had to show them the obvious stains on the seat, which they insisted was just cleaning liquid stains and they said the smell was the smell of the same liquid, but I insisted they clean it once again. I asked them to change the towels too, but they said they had just changed the towels prior to my moving in, but I pointed out I was not sure after seeing the state of the toilet. I am highly disappointed by the way housekeeping was not taking responsibility for the poor cleaning job, especially when it came to matters of hygiene. Again, not expected from such a good hotel. After they left, I hosed down the toilet area myself and threw out all the seemingly touched tissues because I still felt it was smelly. If the hotel is going to inconvenience guests by making them shift rooms, the least they can do is ensure the guest gets a comfortable stay in the next room and there are no unpleasant hiccups.\n",

I was able to borrow the use of crutches and a wheelchair. They gave advice on restaurants, taxis and local transport within Jackson.

I can&#39;t say enough how wonderful they were. The breakfast was very good, had a lot of options and the staff was continually making sure it was clean and stocked. They have a large open breakfast sitting area that my friends and I used for apres ski and for dinner which was great since it was hard for me to get around town. They do not have a bar or restaurant other than for breakfast, so my friends went to the market and local restaurants to get stuff for our apres ski&#47;dinner.

An early check-in could not have been accomodated but we understand from having stayed there that the hotel was pretty relaxed about checkout so we appreciated the allowance on the other side. Checkout time is 12pm however the hotel allowed us access until 2pm which was super convenient as we were travelling with an elder in a wheelchair. Wheelchair was provided by the hotel. Lugagge was taken care of by the Porter by way of a luggage cart. Breakfast was very delicious with ample choice - served from 6.30 to 10.30am. There were so many baked goods, fresh fruit, yoghurts, fresh omlette, juices, native dishes, cheese and even option of rice dishes for breakfast. The dining area is large, bright and very clean - we also liked the colour co-ordination, very modern. Staff were very friendly and always acknowledged the guests whilst passing by - if anything was required in the room, it was dealt with within minutes. We had a slight leak in the shower area which we reported, maintenance arrived within minutes to deal with the issue. The best part was the upgrade to Junior Suite for the room allocated to 3 persons. We really felt like the most welcomed guests. We found that the bathroom cleanliness was not to European standard but this seemed to be the standard in Madinah and Makkah hotels. The location was excellent as the gates of Masjid an-Nabawi are right infront of the hotel. Access to Rawdah is convenient from the hotel also and it was wonderful to hear the adhan in our bedroom and at times the ladies prayed with the jamaat in the hotel room. All in all it was a wonderful stress-free stay, allowing us to focus on our ibaadah.

The rooms don&#39;t look wheelchair accessible. I might be wrong, but it looks like that - in order to get to the elevators leading to the rooms, you first need to get down a flight of stairs from the reception. This means that with your luggage you need to get from the parking garage to the reception in one elevator, then you need to take stairs to take a completely different elevator the the rooms.

      "Negative: My only gripe with the room was that the bed was too high for me to transfer safely across from my wheelchair to the bed (my partner had to help me). The bed needs to be lowered (maybe take the castors off the bottom? That would take a couple of inches off the height).\n",
