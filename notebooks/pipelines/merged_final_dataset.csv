1087,"I really appreciated this candid and loving conversation about traveling with a child who has autism: https://news.delta.com/accessibility-travel-customer-shares-perspective-traveling-autism When we travel, we encounter so many strangers - and this is such a nice reminder that you just never know somebody’s story and to be kind and patient, as much as you can. I particularly liked this exchange (from the piece linked above) with some practical tips on how to make travel easier: “Allison: Accessibility in travel has come a long way, but we know there is still work to be done. From your perspective, what improvements could Delta and the industry make to our processes that would help your family? Donna: I was once on a flight with a woman who discreetly handed out notecards to customers that said she had an autistic child with her and to please be patient. I thought it was such a great idea. I know customers can work with Reservations and Airport Customer Service to ensure crews are notified of someone traveling with an invisible disability who may need additional assistance before boarding – I think others would benefit from knowing that too. [I’ve often thought that] having a pin or lanyard on for employees who have some experience with autism would be a massive help. It would also serve as an identifier for customers. I can sit here and tell you all about what to do, but when you have someone who’s lived it and understands it, that makes a big difference.”",child,1,llm_validated,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1

1075,"I just completed a very enjoyable cruise with my family from Anchorage to Vancouver but I must complain about their airline assistance department. I booked 3 staterooms including a suite for my son’s family and a cabin for my medical aide. We decided to let NCL provide air arrangements, transfer and overnight stay at the Anchorage Hilton for myself, my wife and my aide. The handicapped rooms with roll in shower do not have hand showers! The travel department put my aide on a separate flight from mine for the return journey. I called to change this and was told “because she did not have the same booking number as my itinerary there was nothing that they could do until 10 days before the travel date” even though I said it was not possible for me to travel without my aide! I tried, unsuccessfully, to resolve this sooner but finally 10 days before the flight, the resolution department agreed to put her on my flight at an additional cost of $480 which I reluctantly agreed to. I then contacted Alaska Air handicapped assistance to have my seat move nearer the front of the plane since I require an aisle chair. There I was told I should never have been put on the Vancouver to Seattle leg of the trip because it was in Embraer 160 plane which is not allowed to carry lithium batteries even in the main cabin. I called NCL travel resolution who said I should have known that it’s on their website but I pointed out that depending on how you query the mobility section of your website you may or may not be shown the warnings about the Embraer planes.

51,"For my 60th birthday year, Chet and I took my dream trip to Japan. We journeyed as far north as Nikko National Park and as far south as Nagasaki. We saw ancient temples and shrines, wild monkeys, amazing forests, and interesting museums. We ate at 7 11, Family Mart and Lawson convenience stores, restaurants, and local markets. We dipped our toes in the Japan Sea, climbed sand dunes, and even rode a camel. We traveled in a Mini Wink camper van from Japan Campers for three weeks, driving up and down crazy mountain roads, driving through rice paddies, and in the city traffic of Toyoko and Osaka. We camped at Michi No Eki roadside stops and other stops recommended by the Japan Campers app. We hope you will join us on this trip of a lifetime. We had a blast, and I hope you will enjoy joining us through this video series. We also lightly discuss accessibility that we see in our journey. This episode starts our journey from Japan Campers Narita, Japan to Nikko National Park. We spent the morning traveling pass beautiful places including rice fields, forests, stream, and small towns, and spent the afternoon starting our exploration of Nikko National Park. We are Betsy and Chet, and our oldest son, Alex. For 33 years, we thought Alex, had nonverbal autism, intellectual disability, ADHD, but a few years ago we found out that he has Phelan McDermid. Alex goes on many trips with us, but this time the plane trip is too far. Part of the reason we make these videos is to share the world with Alex and others who are unable to make a journey to Japan. We have no idea what Alex understands receptively, so videos are a way to visually communicate where we went for three weeks. He likes to use his eye gaze communication device to watch his vacation videos so now in a way he can see Japan with us. Our videos, Goal 1: Joyful Life are based on our family's journey and strategies we use to improve the quality of our life through meaningful leisure experiences. It is our hope to reach our number one goal of having a joyful life and to help others reach that goal too.

938,"Hi, I'm Pam, a proud Disney Adult! I completed an internship at Walt Disney World through Disney University, worked there for a few years, and am now a religious vlog watcher and travel agent! You would think that I would've known all that there is to know about Walt Disney World with that resume, but it wasn't until I traveled with family and friends with disabilities that I learned first-hand about accessible travel. To me, being a true ally to the disabled community is learning from their lived experiences, so I am grateful that I now have this knowledge to pass on along with all of my other tips and tricks! Walt Disney World is beloved for many reasons, and one of those is its vast options of accessible activities. I recommend reading the descriptions of the rides online ahead of time to see which ones not only seem accessible for you, but are experiences that you would enjoy! Some rides you can stay in a power wheelchair, while others require a transfer. Some rides have specific seats for those needing to transfer. One example is the brand new Tron ride at Magic Kingdom. The standard seat looks similar to a motorcycle, but there is a ""caboose"" in the back that is an accessible seat. If you are capable of transferring, one thing that I learned is that when the cast members (workers) ask ""can you transfer?"" first ask ""what are my options?"" One example for this is the Jungle Cruise ride in Magic Kingdom. My friend said that she could transfer and she did. The steepness of the stairs getting into and out of the ride were more steep than she thought. My daughter and I ended up helping her quite a bit, which we were happy to do, but we found out after that there was an accessible boat where she could have stayed in a wheelchair! Another great option is the Disability Access Pass (DAS) which is intended for guests who have difficulty tolerating extended waits in a conventional queue environment due to a disability. This pass allows guests to request a return time for a specific experience that is comparable to the current standby wait. This feature permits guests using the DAS to enjoy other experiences in the park instead of physically waiting in the standby line. Guests can register in person or pre-register via live video call (the guest with a disability must be present) and use DAS Advance pre-arrival planning. It is most convenient to use the DAS on the My Disney Experience app which is available for smart phones. This app has so many great features. Besides the DAS, two that are very helpful are the listed updated wait times and the ability to pre-order quick service food. Speaking of planning ahead, while there are wheelchairs and mobility scooters available to rent (for a fee) at the parks, it is much more economical and efficient to rent through an outside company. When mobility aids are rented through the park, they have to stay in the park. Renting through an outside company allows you to take the wheelchair or scooter anywhere. Some of the resorts at Walt Disney World are huge, so the walk from the hotel to the bus could be very exhausting. A company called Scooterbug is the exclusive provider of mobility devices for Walt Disney World. This distinction is important because they can drop off the scooter at your resort without you being present. With the possibility of flight delays or other mishaps, this service offers great peace of mind. One thing that we learned when asking the front desk for my friend's scooter: if you book through an agent, the device could possibly be under their name. Mobility devices and scooters aren't the only pieces of equipment available for rent (from other companies - Scooterbug only offers wheelchairs, scooters, and strollers). One example for this is that my friend rented an IV pole for her feeding tube. While enjoying is priority number one, it is also a good idea to know the medical services available ahead of time just in case. AdventHealth is the official healthcare provider of Walt Disney World. They have medical equipment for rent, urgent care services, virtual appointments available 24/7, in-park first aid, and a new full-service emergency room minutes from Walt Disney World. While we never like to think about these things happening on vacation, knowing that these services are conveniently available and accessible provides peace of mind when travelling. Walt Disney World has accessible room options in all of their hotels. It is important to think about what you need ahead of time so that questions can be asked before booking the room. Some of these questions are the height of the bed and whether you need a powered door to get in and out of the room. Only you know what you need best! Working with a travel agent who has experience in accessible travel can also help you to brainstorm some questions specific to your needs. I could talk about Walt Disney World all day long! If you have any questions, let them in the comments below and I’m happy to answer. You can also search and book on accessible GO today!",child,0,llm_validated,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1

837,"We just visited the Hilton Resort in Quebec City in Canada after a great cruise. However the hotel is terrible for assessable needs. Even though their website promotes assessable, it is NOT assessable! The only thing included was wide door openings. There was no ADA higher toilet. It was extremely low as if designed for a child. There were no handrails around the toilet either. The shower did not have a chair to sit on. The shower had only one hold bar that was opposite the controls and was under the shower head. You could not reach the hold bar while standing by the water controls. We had reserved a one bedroom suite and the bed was so wide that you could not ride a wheelchair or rollator to move upward towards the headboard to get onto the bed itself! We were extremely disappointed in this hotel, especially when we were told that all their “assessable” rooms were the same way. I guess Canada has a different attitude toward assessability.

587,"My granddaughter is getting married in a few weeks. She and her future hubs reserved a block of rooms at the Marriott Detroit at the Renaissance Center. When they arranged for the rooms, they provided their contact person with our specific needs, i.e. a mobility handicapped room for one person (son, 34) with a connecting or adjoining room for 2, so we can assist our son as needed. The reservations clerk took note of the wedding party and seemed very competent. When I received email confirmation after the rooms were booked, the following note was at the bottom of the confirmation page: “Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center will make every effort to accommodate the below requests, however they are not guaranteed. HANDICAPPED; C1” The hotel front desk refuses to discuss, saying I must use the 800# for reservations. The reservations people say they are powerless to guarantee the handicapped room. My granddaughter has reached out to her contact person who set up the block of rooms, but has been ghosted for over a week. We are only planning to stay one night, so my son can survive an overnight without a shower. What is not negotiable is the installation of grab bars at the toilet, as he is unable to transfer without them. The lack of a guaranteed handicapped room puts us in an impossible situation. I can still cancel our reservation, and find another hotel, or we can drive home several hours late at night in unpredictable early March weather, following a long and very busy and tiring day.

He is now an adult and a parent of twins. For Christmas he asked me for this book to give to his children. I no longer had the one we read when he was a child, so we went on Amazon and to our delight we discovered it was still offered for sale. When it arrived, my son's eyes lit up with joy and with the wonderful memories this book brought back. Here's hoping his twins will love this book as much as their daddy did as a child.

Yesterday 6th January our flight had been rescheduled from 18.30 for 11am today, due to technical problems which they couldn't fix that night. After a fair amount of announcements it was decided we would be put up at the Hilton hotel next door. So we all had to go back to immigration and then collect our luggage and schlep to the BA desk to collect our vouchers. We duly went along to the Hilton hotel and waited in line to eventually be told there were no more rooms available to the rest of us - by now it was 10pm so we were tired and feeling a little strained, especially those with small children. The desk staff told us they were trying to phone BA to ask what to do with the rest of us but were getting no answer from them. So at this stage my husband and I decided to come home and got a very expensive taxi back to London safe in the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 11am on the 7th January. We duly left home this morning at 8am to get here in time for our 11am flight only to be met with the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 18.30 tonight. Oh dear BA, why couldn't you let us all know this by sending an email with a phone number to drop into our inboxes sometime during the night? Just too efficient for you I guess. So we've been kindly issued with vouchers to cover breakfast which they didnt do, no problem BA we didn't mind forking out another Â£5 to cover it.

After this perfect flight, transit in LHR terminal was again relaxing. Stroller was again waiting for us at the gate, very nice. After security we went to the first lounge which was really was crowded, but we found a quiet place to sit. Time for a shower, breakfast and relax.

In order to get this new flight I had to be at JFK Airport at 1:45 pm. To make this happen, I had to skip all last minute arrangements.

I was warmly greeted by a member of the crew, who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and have a look around, all because I expressed a slight interest, and for that I am thankful. The flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpit. The seat was very well presented, there was a small amenity kit, as well as a pair of pyjamas. The seat was clean with pillows, as well as ample storage space. You get a closet to hang clothes, a little compartment next to the seat, as well as the overhead bin, so I never ran out of room. The pre-departure beverage was a choice of water, orange juice, or champagne and hot towels were handed out. The flight left slightly behind schedule, but at Heathrow, this is something you expect.

The bed was very comfortable and at just over 6 feet tall, I did not have any issues fitting into the bed and stretching out. There were plenty of blankets and pillows available and I slept very well. When I awoke, I was offered coffee and a short while later, breakfast. The breakfast choices were continental, or cooked. I opted for the cooked option and I was not disappointed, as it was very tasty, and there was a lot of it. The inflight entertainment was good, and there was a large range of films, TV programmes/series, audio books, and kids programmes to choose from. The system was responsive and was good quality, although I did not watch any films, so I cannot speak of the sound quality. The crew served with a smile and even when I asked for a Latte, which the machine didnât do, the crew went out of their way to make one for me which was very nice.

On that trip the entertainment system failed all together. On the return journey from Male I watched what I thought to be a three part crime drama called ""the tunnel"". Only after watching the third part did I discover that there was a fourth or more! Why? Why would you not have all the story? This experience aside many airlines have better entertainment systems in economy than the BA service in business on this route. When you are paying this kind of money to take two children business class you want good entertainment to keep them occupied. They don't need the space! Would also have been nice to sit together! Food was grim my ten year old son who normally devours everything ate nothing on both legs of the trip. A ten hour flight with travel at either end is a long time without food. There seemed to be a hurry to serve the food throw a bottle of water at you and then shut down service until an hour before arrival. On the outbound journey I pressed the service button after 15 minutes it self cancelled. Pressed again 15 minutes later it self cancelled. I returned my glass to the galley myself the staff were so busy chatting amongst themselves they didn't notice me. Presumably this is why they didn't see the service request either.

No other seat available due to a full flight. Just the cabin service director was able to get me a change to 13B, a seat a little further away from the restrooms. But still recurring disturbing odors and noisier flight on main deck. - I have gotten already 2620 EC tier points this year and have little understanding for how they treated me. I am so regularly flying with them, they know my preferences: upper deck, aisle seat and as much in front as possible. I am ready to give up my seat for families with infants or any handicapped person, but upon their reaction I guess this was not the case.  Communication is marketing and this was very bad done by BA this time! Why should I be loyal to a company which is not respecting my loyalty benefits?

However, I have a special dietary need and I was not able to click on this for the flight. With BA, you get meals, snacks and drinks included so I knew that we would have a meal with a 5 hour flight. While on board, I was able to choose the fruit option for breakfast on the way there - however on the way back it was a cold deli option which consisted of a wrap, a roll and some crackers. I asked if there was a gluten free option and the assistant said ""No just this"". Following this we could have pretzels and biscuits with a drink. Obviously someone like me who is a coeliac cannot eat anything with wheat/gluten so I was left with a slab of cheese which should have gone with the crackers. BA really need to address this as it is not fair to advertise they provide meals on board when clearly there was nothing available for me.

As in leg one BKK-LHR my pre-assigned business class seat that I had selected months before departure mysteriously vanished at the gate. In the end BA needed the seat for a family to be seated together. All well and good mind you but to have the audacity to charge passengers for these seats and give them away is absolutely disgraceful. As such my quiet no traffic window seat on the upper deck was quickly relegated to a high traffic aisle seat on the main deck right near the lavatory and galley ensuring no sleep on the overnight flight. As a loyal OneWorld Emerald passenger I can honestly say BA really don't care about us in this (or any) regard. The CSD was sympathetic and kind but nobody else seemed to care one bit. That hasn't happened to me on any other carrier for years and has happened twice in the past few weeks on BA. Moral of the story: Never ever pay BA for a pre-assigned seat as there is simply no guarantee you will get what you pay for.

Pre-booked seats at the same time. I was rather surprised when I got an email two weeks out saying âabout your flight to Madrid on the 26th Mayâ when I was flying direct Heathrow to Menorca. Airline assured me everything was fine. Further concern when self-service check-in opened 24 hours out, wife and daughters checked in fine, me and my son were referred to airport check-in (despite all being on the same booking). An urgent call to BA I was told 1) I was probably being moved to a bassinet position. When I pointed out this was utter nonsense she reneged and said 2) infants canât check in online which I now understand is also incorrect. My concern was well placed. At BA T5 bag drop, check in agent looked flustered, a note in the booking prompted her to call various people and after about ten minutes she handed me a bunch of boarding passes. Only after I checked them she sheepishly admitted that our pre-booked seats were gone, my son and I had no seats at all and were standby, and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin (16 rows apart). âPrebooked seating is not guaranteed you know!â After kicking up a huge fuss (I believe they canât legally sit children below a certain age away from parents?) the check-in manager offered me no explanation other than full flights, but promised me it would be sorted once they got round to closing my flight. Fast forward to the gate â utter carnage including the check-in supervisor (who cant have been more than 22) in tears. When I eventually got seen I was finally given a seat number for me and my son, again many rows apart from the rest of my family. As this was my sons first ever flight, I was absolutely livid that we couldnât sit anywhere near each other. Added to that, my son is breastfed so how we are going to manage feeding, kids needing toilet etc. I put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat together thank goodness. We boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore & holding my son I get to my assigned seat and someone is in it. Asking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seat. Cue BA staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes. Such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff, I even heard one of them mutter âcheck boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flightâ! Fast forward another 5 mins and the plane is now pushing back with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not an empty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that weâre going to have to get off here and my children in tears. Much checking of iPads and a BA staff member is then found (there were quite a few on the flight apparently) and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight (what seat?).

I booked a flight to Florence through BA website, received a British Airways e-ticket and only found out on the day when trying to check in that I was flying with Vueling. Never heard of them. To cut a very long story short we were delayed 8 hours, nothing said to us and nothing offered at this stage. At the gate, when we finally got there, one of the customers checked their website to find the flight had not left Italy yet. We informed the ground staff. They did not day a thing. After half an hour trying to get answers from them we were told we would have to wait till the next flight arrived (how long we couldn't be told) and they would then fly us to a different airport 2 hours away and arrange a bus transfer. I headed straight back the the terminal and sought a British Airways rep to try and get an answer, firstly because that is who I booked my ticket through and secondly as Vueling have no representation at the airport. I was told it had nothing to do with British Airways and they couldn't help. I explained the situation again and asked to speak to a Supervisor. I was denied that right. I by chance saw a 'Customer Service Representative' walking past 5 minutes later and asked to speak to him.

2310,"Vancouver to Barcelona via Heathrow with British Airways. I would like to start this review by stating that the only reviews I've taken time to write in my life were positive ones, choosing to ignore negativity. This however will sadly be my first negative review and even sadder to say that I'm taking time to write this before we've even completed our round trip with British Airways, to be more direct I'm writing this on our final connector flight to Barcelona. On February 24th, 2016 I purchased a round trip with cancellation flight from Vancouver, Canada to Barcelona, Spain. This was a surprise for fiance for her 30th birthday as well as our 1 year engagement anniversary. Naturally we counted down the days in excitement booking ourselves an apartment and scheduling reservations for dinner as well as tickets to a Barcelona FC match. Even setting up scheduling for grandparents on each side for our 9 month old daughter.  April 16th, 1 day before our trip I receive a email labeled ""updated travel itinerary."" When I opened the email, our flights no longer included our flight from Vancouver to Barcelona, actually they only had a return flight from Barcelona on April 27th. As I had got home late on April 16th from Cuba, I couldn't contact anyone until early morning of April 17th (my Fiance's birthday). Convinced it was just a mistake we thought nothing of it. Upon calling in the morning we were informed that our flight had been ""cancelled"". We tried everything we could to make any flight happen that day but were told there was only 1 seat remaining and that my fiance could fly out on the 17th and I follow on the 18th, which as an engaged couple makes no sense. We decided to look past this and try to seek reimbursement for the apartments fees and other things that we were now out of money on due to arriving a day late. This began a huge run around of my fiance trying to submit their online form 3 separate times only for the screen to read ""submitting"" for roughly 30-60 minutes each time, never one actually submitting. We decide again to overlook this and deal with it at the check in counter at YVR. The agent we were speaking to was a very nice lady who went above and beyond to figure out what happened to our flight the previous day as it left as originally scheduled without us on it. She put a note on our file that an agent from Jacksonville BA had cancelled our flights for no apparent reason. We asked for an upgrade on our seats, that wasn't available to us. We asked for access to the BA lounge while we waited, we were told that was full even though we walked past an empty lounge on the way to our flight. After a very uncomfortable flight to Heathrow we spoke to an agent there, who again was helpful in pulling up our file notes and sending a email to get the ball rolling for us on the reimbursement process (which we still have to wait for a reply before we can go ahead trying to recoup slome of our losses, which unfortunately still wouldn't get us the day we missed back). She went the extra step to grant us access to the lounge while waiting and moved our seats up a few rows. That was a breath of fresh air until we realized that we had been moved to the row right behind the curtains. While we snacked on a 1/4 of a sandwich portion of food we could hear the plated dishes on the other side of the curtains and good food people were eating all the while staring at minimum 4 empty seats.

3657,Travelling as a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 young children) from London to Boston I hoped there wouldn't be a problem sitting together in the 4 middle seats. I had not paid to reserve my seat as I had never had to pay extra before while flying with Emirates Singapore or Cathay Pacific. The seats allocated at check in were 3 on the left (A/B/C). My wife sat with the kids while I had to sit in the row behind. The seats could not be changed at check in or on the plane. It seemed ridiculous that we were not allocated the logical place for a family of 4 in the middle of the plane even though my flight had been booked 5 months in advance. I warned the stewardess that the situation would be difficult for my family for the staff and the passengers around as this proved when my 3 year old cried as he wanted to sit next to me. I had to swap seats with my wife a couple of times during the flight it was a stressful flight. On the return flight I reluctantly paid extra (Â£23 x 4) to make sure we got the 4 middle seats. The journey was less stressful but my wife had her own issues as she couldn't recline as the passenger behind was too tall and refused to move his legs (he should have paid and extra Â£23 and reserved a seat with more leg room). My wife complained to the steward as the passenger refused to let my wife recline he was made to move to a different seat. In conclusion I found staff were generally friendly but didn't exert themselves on service the food was okay but the entertainment system was dated it didn't have any games and the screen kept freezing. It seems the flight services to USA are not up to the same standard as flying to the Middle East or the Far East as British Airways had failed in comparison at all levels when compared with the other airlines mentioned earlier - my last experience to the USA was with American Airlines and that was worse than BA. The main disappointing issue with BA is definitely having to pay extra for choosing your seat. If you are travelling with a family of 4 and you want to guarantee you sit together you have to pay an extra Â£200 on top of the original cost of the return ticket this felt more like the additional charges of Ryanair!,child,1,agreed,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

What let this flight down was the number of unruly children on this flight.

The couple to her rear were sat throughout the flight crossed legged in the isle playing with their children and their toys and my wife had to struggle passed them every time she wished to use the toilet. Surely a tripping hazard! There were many other children on the flight who were well behaved so it can be done if parents set boundaries for their offspring.

The 'food' was a soggy half-wrap with a filling-free miniature roll - it was unacceptable on a 2hr45m flight. No choice offered by the cabin crew even though they had 3 options. The claim that their food offering is appropriate to the time of day is hogwash - we were served exactly the same thing at 10.30am on the outbound flight as at midnight on the return. Although we benefited from it on this trip BA need to change their hand luggage policy. There simply isn't space for 150+ passengers to bring 2 bags which caused a lot of angst particularly on the return trip (both flights were completely full). On the upside both flights were on time and the crews were friendly - the return crew dealt well with a potentially disruptive family group.,child,0,agreed,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
1695,"London Heathrow to Phoenix. I have been flying with British Airways for years, although I haven't used them recently. I was surprised at the service or lack of service. Our national carrier has turned into the worst. The crew are nce and friendly, so no real complaints apart from on a 10.5 hour flight during the day, they were nowhere to be seen until about 1.5 hours before landing. The food was absolutely appalling. For dinner we were offered a choice between meat and vegetarian. I had chicken filet which was as hard as leather with some sort of indistinguishable brown gravy and totally tasteless.The chicken was served sweet potatoe mash and a pea purÃ©e, this was the only thing edible on the plate. A tiny beetroot salad. The obligatory hard as rock bread roll. For dessert, a small piece of chocolate brownie.Complimentary drinks were out of sight so most people didn't realise they could ask for wine etc. A small container of water was on the tray.This meal was served about 2 hours into the flight and then nothing again to eat until roughly before landing. At which time was served a folded slice of pizza served in a box, a packet of crisp and popcorn (all carbohydrates) and a small container of water. I tasted the pizza and it was tasteless and just like cardboard.So I left it and took the crisps and popcorn with me.Then tea/coffee was served.  I am not expecting a gourmet meal, but there was no thought given to the food provided on British Airways. There was no fruit, no salad, or proper vegetables. There were no soft drinks offered or any proper serving of even the basic water. The flight entertainment did not exist. A couple of new films, the rest were old or unheard of. The music/radio (audio) was the same with no new music or unheard of artists. My daughter, booked this expensive direct flight for me to my destination in the US. I have asked her not to book me on British Airways again. I would rather travel on Virgin or Delta indirect.

It was particularly annoying to see children sitting in row 1 - the only row with reasonable leg room. Service was fine and the food quite good, but no entertainment at all.

There was only one person at the counter in Milan and no employee told any of the passengers about the flight cancellation. Customers were furious, screaming at the lonely representative, because British Airways was not giving any answers or solving the problem. My daughter missed her flight, was not offered a meal, a hotel room and only given the option to fly with Iberia through Madrid and then connect to Mexico City. Her bag was sent to a distant belt and was never told she had to pick it up and retrieve her luggage. This has been a total disaster. I had also paid for a good seat on her long flight to Mexico City, and now I will have to write and complain and wait for a refund. British Airways was an excellent airline, until suddenly everything changed. On my last trip my bag never arrived at Heathrow, I was given a short connection time therefore I lost my next flight.

2687,"Have flown previously in British Airways Business Class. Flew in World Traveler economy class on this trip, with adult children on their first flight to England. Loading was chaotic. Seated middle four seat section, row 49. No air conditioning in cabin. Several of us complained about heat and lack of air flow. Did not get answer from stewardess until an hour into the flight. Took 3 hours before air conditioning kicked in. No room under the seat to store handbag. Seats appear to be smaller. When person in row in front of me reclined, I had minimal room to move or to access my purse. Little attention from cabin attendants. Told them I was getting dizzy from lack of cool air, and they allowed me to move to seat in galley where air was cooler from Business Class seats. Food served was terrible. No advance menu to choose from. No individual lighting or air. I thought it was my worst experience until immigration 2.5 hour wait in line to clear immigration / customs. Our prepaid taxi waited 90 minutes and then left. Horrible experience. The return flight was worse.

On time departure (a rarity it seems at LGW for BA) A320 in fair condition with additional leg room in Club Europe and two excellent flight attendants. The return (22/7/2014) was a different story. Probably my worst BA flight ever. Delayed departure from TFS though only about 10 minutes late in arrival at LGW. No additional leg room on this A320 in Club Europe. Lazy cabin crew who did the bare minimum with limited grace. And screaming infants out of control toddlers and ignorant teenagers in the Club Europe cabin - not the airline's fault but they could have and should have done more to manage the situation. One example - two teenagers in row 1 immediately reclined their seats into the faces of the couple in front of us after take off. The cabin crew didn't even make the teenagers raise their seats during the meal service. All credit to the couple in front of us though. They had the manners not to recline their seats into our faces. The substantial premium to fly Club Europe is just not worth it when other people's children are not controlled and the promised additional 'personal space' is not provided.

It turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldn't let all the passengers on the plane. So quite randomly (not) 9 people were selected and turned away. We were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances, if I had connecting flights in London etc. I sought compensation from BA (which I was told I could do) and what an absolute nightmare this process has been. They wouldn't acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalf. Even though, I booked and paid for the tickets. So, I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times. Every time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadn't. There was no other way except to post from Australia to the UK to some office. Eventually, it finally go through to them. I have now chased up the reimbursement four times. Each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient. Today they tell me that they need to check my account details. So, again, I send them the same information that I have done before.

We booked online to travel on Jan 21st from Canton, Ohio to Chicago through American Airlines, from Chicago to Hyderabad via Doha but AA flight got delayed for several hours and they donât know how much time it takes, they were keep on changing AA flight time, later we realized itâs impossible to catch connecting flight in Chicago (we already wasted several hours while waiting), so we discussed with AA staff, they took almost 4 hours and finally they said we have to rebook tickets to next day and they cannot rebook through Qatar but said they can rebook with BA (British Airways) for next day ie. Jan 22nd from Cleveland to Chicago through AA flight and from Chicago to India through BA flight. I agreed for that because we donât have any other feasible options at that time. On Jan 22nd we were able to flew from Cleveland to Chicago in AA flight but in Chicago BA staff did not allow me to board in BA flight because they said I donât have unexpired US visa (I already have H4 approval petition but donât have unexpired US visa and already scheduled for visa appointment in India). I did not know that I need a visa to travel in BA and AA staff who changed our entire itinerary (it supposed to be with Qatar Airways but changed to BA) never told us about visa restrictions with BA even though we spent 4 hours in their counter while standing. BA staff were very rude in Chicago, did not help us in any way. I was worried about what happens next and how to take care of my 4 months old son and my mother who does not speak English, more over Chicago is not my home town and donât know anyone there. Then I got an idea to meet with Qatar staff because Qatar Airways was my original airline, wanted to give a try, then my fate changed entirely. I encountered with Qatar Airways staff and my experience with them was wonderful and they rebooked our tickets with the Qatar flight which will be starting with in 40 minutes from Chicago without asking for single penny.  Qatar Airways staff acted very fast, cleared all formalities within minutes and believe it or not within 30 minutes we were in the flight. I still cannot believe how Qatar Airways staff helped us, the way they treated us, cleared everything in minutes and handled the situation especially when we need a help very badly and with very bad experience earlier with other airlines (AA and BA) even though we approached them in last minute. I am very much thankful to Qatar Airways staff otherwise I would have suffered a lot especially with my 4 months old son and my mother, both completely depends on me. I wanted to take some time to put all my experiences, thatâs why I am putting little bit late review.",child,1,agreed,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
3745,Had a really good experience flying with Emirates from Bengaluru to Dammam via Dubai. Both flights were on time. The aircraft used on the BLR-DXB sector was a bit old. The entertainment was amazing but the touch screen was not responsive. The food was not that good to be frank and the cabin crew were very friendly. They gave toys for kids and had special food for them. Flight landed on time but we were parked away from the terminal and the bus took around 30 minutes to arrive at the aircraft. Since I had 5 hrs layover it was not a problem for me. The aircraft used on the DXB-DMM sector was a brand new aircraft and this aircraft was much better than the previous one. The screens were much larger and they were very responsive unlike the previous one but could not do much since it was only a 45 minute flight. The sandwich served was awful. Crew communication on both the sectors was really good and I would love to fly with Emirates again.,child,1,llm_validated,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

1409,"We chose to fly with Qatar Airways to the Maldives with our two young sons (5 and 8 years old). When we arrived at Heathrow we were informed our flight had only just departed Doha due to technical difficulties, which meant a 7 hour delay at the airport with 2 young children. We were offered a Â£40 voucher for the whole family for food and refreshments. We effectively lost a day of our holiday. When we booked our tickets, we ensured we selected flights which had a brief (< 2 hour) stopover in Doha and we paid a premium compared to options with a far longer stopover. Shortly before our holiday we received a notification of a change of flights which meant we now had a 6 hour stopover in Doha for the return journey - something we had wanted to avoid with our 2 young children. I contacted Qatar by telephone (no easy task) to request an alternative flight but this was not possible and no explanation was given for the change. On arrival in Doha, the Qatar Airways transfer staff were unhelpful and not interested in providing us with any lounge access to allow our children to rest (we were in Doha airport from 10pm to 4am local time). We tried numerous lounges at Hamad International Aiport and were willing to pay for access but nobody was able to help us.  We tried to reserve premium seats on some of the flights via the Qatar app, but each time we were unable to complete the additional payment. I contacted Qatar by telephone to reserve our seats but was told I was not able to do this because I booked through an agent (Expedia). I contacted Expedia and was told I needed to contact the airline to reserve âpreferredâ seats. I contacted Qatar once more and spoke to a different associate who advised me that I could indeed reserve these seats after all. This whole process was convoluted and time consuming and a demonstration of the poor customer interface and lack of staff training.

When meal was served, I was asked for drinks. I asked for a beer which was not available immediately but I was told she would get it for me which never turned up. The whole thing was so unorganized. Not to mention the food was low grade. It would have been much better if they didnt actually keep the food. The flight landed even before we could be offered coffee. We thought may be this would be a one off case as we have always heard high words for the Emirates experience. On the way back the experience turned to be even worst. It started from the queue at the Airport! The online check-in queue was bigger than the normal check-in. Upon looking at the queue, we asked the representative if there is any priority for child in arm upon which we were told ""no"". Few minutes later we see a staff in the Emirates attire. When we went there as our child was crying, she rudely said that we should have asked her and the others are not Emirates staff as if it was our duty to train the outsourced staff of how to behave with their airline clients!

Just one hour after flight they brought a box of food which included a small water, a kid juice, a pastry and a cold very dry cheese sandwich that was very hard to swallow. one hour later they threw a bottle of water at us, Then for eight hours no service. During this eight hours a few people went to the galley including myself and ask for something to eat they said they or out and don't have anything. Again after 8 hours they brought a brown bag which had the same things inside. As we know and understand we are dealing with Covid-19 but this should not be the excuse for this airline to serve this nasty food and cut the service and pocket more money in their pockets. The air plane was 90% full, I am sure they made money. There is nothing wrong with serving hot meals which was all covered up and came from over directly to the passengers. They could easily served small bottles of a wines, alcohol, sodas, hot tea and coffee. If all this are served in the restaurants why not air planes? One the biggest part of traveling and entertainment is food, In the air plane eating good food and good drinks make your time more enjoyable and your travel time goes a lot faster and you always remember the good food. My sister just traveled to Turkey by KLM airline and went through Europe, She could not talk enough about how good the food and the service was. They were served two hot meals, drinks and snacks through out the flight while the flight was only 30% full which for sure the airline is losing money.

Their in-flight food service is mediocre. Although, the food is above average. They offer minimal service when it comes to offering water or drinks during the flight. I tried upgrading using family account points, a feature with Emirates. It is more or less a scam scheme designed to pool all your points in your family account. The idea is you can upgrade your journey or family members' journey using the family account. However, you cannot access these points when you want to upgrade. So you are left with no points in your account and storing all your points in your family account, and you can't use them. Emirates airport staffs and cabin crews are so poorly trained. Both Airline check-in staff, Cabin Crew and support staff have no clue how the family account works. I heard 4-different versions of the policies. They send me round in circles on 2 different trips, and the issue still remains unresolved after a week. As a gold member, I get a pleasant smile and a warm welcome, but that is just faking a few words that have no value whatsoever. Anytime I requested any help, I more or less got nothing for being Gold.

Over an hour later we were told it was resolved and we left the gate again. As we were taxiing the pilot came on and said that Narita Airport had decided to conduct runway maintenance so we had to return to the gate again. This was the first problem - this was a lie. Narita Airport does not allow any aircraft to take off after midnight, this is why we could not take off and there is no way that Emirates did not know this. We returned to the gate and waited for an hour with no information. Then they said they would serve dinner - this is at 1am! I had no desire to eat dinner at 1am. With no further information we were told we had to deplane at 3am - so nearly five hours on the tarmac - and the ground staff would deal with us when we got off the plane.

We flew from Los Angeles to Tashkent via Istanbul and back from Tashkent to Los Angeles after spending 2 weeks in Tashkent with 3 days stop in Istanbul. We really liked Istanbul and it's touristic attractions. We bought tickets via Expedia and I paid full price for my son's ticket. When checking in in Istanbul TK representatives told us that we have to buy new ticket for our son since the one we bought was a child ticket, but it has to be a baby ticket as our son is under 2 years old. They told us that on previous 3 hops TK made a mistake allowing our baby onboard and they sent us to to a ticket office where I got charged an additional 130 USD for a new ticket for our son. It's the kind of Turkish Bazar experience you get when you deal with TK. It was a very stressful situation for our family as we were almost late to our flight to LA. I was very angry and was not able to sleep during our flight to LA. It's a completely different experience with Turkish Airlines in other countries as in Tashkent/Uzbekistan and Los Angeles their representatives are more customer focused. 3 years ago I had another bad experience with Turkish Airlines in Istanbul when TK oversold tickets to our flight to Los Angeles. They push people who bought tickets in advance with cheaper rates to stay and chose a different flight making a priority for those who paid higher buying tickets closer to departure date. That creates a stressful experience for the passengers since they don't have seats on their boarding passes. They first push you that you don't have seat available and later gamble proposing bonuses to passengers to abandon a flight and you have to stand firm to take your flight. Somebody agrees at the end to abandon a flight. Our Turkish Airlines experience was so bad that it spoilt our impression about our vacation in Turkey.

3224,"Brisbane to Zurich via Dubai. After hearing nothing but great things about Emirates I have been left so disappointed. Our first leg from Brisbane to Dubai started with them not giving my 7 year old daughter her meal. Not only did they forget the first meal of the 14hr flight but I had to ask them again for the second meal. Approximately 4 hours out from Dubai the oxygen masks dropped from the panels above. After 15 long minutes we were advised that they thought it is a technical issue. Passengers were then asked to fold up the oxygen masks as best we could and they were left hanging in front of us. Following this there was no in-flight entertainment or service for the remainder of the flight. No compensation was offered and staff seemed more concerned about passengers who were recording the incident. After our horrendous flight and poor service from Brisbane, I asked at Heathrow about an upgrade and was told flights to Brisbane were fully booked. This was not true as the Dubai to Brisbane leg was half empty and many people had three seats to themselves. The check in procedure at Heathrow we had to use the self service machines and this was not made clear until we had already queued for 25 minutes. There were no toilets in the lounges at Heathrow and Dubai which meant that once you had shown your passport and ticket and gone into the lounge you had to go back outside to the toilets and then queue again. Our flight from London departed at 9pm. My daughter didnât end up getting her meal until 11.50pm. It took them 2.5hrs to commence the meal service. The flight from Dubai to Brisbane was no better. My 7 year old needed to go to the toilet as soon as we got on the plane and the toilet hadnât been cleaned. My 7 year old fell asleep on take off so I asked if her meal could be kept for later when she woke up. I was told this was not a problem however when I asked for it 7 hours later I was told we she couldnât have as they couldnât reheat it. I then had to ask if I could at least get the other food that didnât require being reheated. The customer service on three of the four flights was absolutely appalling. The flight attendants were not pleasant and friendly.  On one flight I pressed the buzzer for some water due to my daughter being asleep on me and no-one attended at all â the plane landed 1.5 hours after I pressed the buzzer and we disembarked. I could not get over the amount of time the seat belt signs came on when there was barely any turbulence. On top of this, the excessive amount of time they kept the seatbelt sign on when there was no turbulence was ridiculous. At one point it had been on for over one hour and my daughter needed the toilet. We got up to go to the toilet and I was told I would be going at our own risk.  It felt to me that they kept the seat belt sign on for an extended period so the crew got out of doing work.

And even then, nothing ever gets anywhere. I just flew from DC to Kazan via Istanbul. I had a ticket through their points and realized I needed to make a change to the ticket - I needed to add an infant seat. I could make a brand new reservation for the same exact same amount of miles as my old one plus 4,500 additional points for the infant seat. The call center could do the same. However, they couldn't change my old one. I asked them to cancel it - they couldn't do that either. They told me to do at the airport before my flight. When I left my home for the airport, the new ticket with an infant seat was still available. When I got to the airport, their system was down. The sales agent said my only option is to pay $450 for the infant seat because their system was down. He said I can write in after and get a refund. When I did, they refused my refund. All I needed to do was pay a $25 change fee or a $50 cancellation fee and pay 4,500 more miles. Their system was down, so I couldn't. A 5-year old can tell you that the right thing to do is refund me the difference between what I paid and what I was going to pay if their system wasn't down.

Boarding on time, clean aircraft and good business seats. I chose Air France over BA on this route to try out an alternative. I have now flown a few times with Air France and rate them highly.

The FlyBe flight to Southampton was fine, friendly staff. All in all a good flight. What is not clear though and this was also true of AF ground staff is where these flights are sold as Air France flights on a business class ticket (and priced as such ), and then the short hop to UK is with FlyBe (which lacks a business cabin), we should still get access to the lounges of Air France (relevant if you have a long layover). In fairness to Air France, I had asked them about this in advance (told we would have access) and then when I turned up with my children today, the agent said, technically we did not have access. However, she used her discretion and let us in as we had flown from Dubai with them. Whilst I do not know what is right or wrong, its gestures like that which make me really like Air France.

I argued with them that they destroyed the luggage so why should my insurance pay for their damaged caused, also the 500HKD would never cover a new suitcase (bought a year ago) so I asked to see somebody from Singapore airlines .. a girl appeared and immediately the same offer was made but the amount got up to 800HKD .. I argued that the money wouldn't even cover a new one. So she agreed to have my luggage picked up from my place in Hkg and tried to have it repaired. Nothing happened for 3 days and I was forced to contact the airline direct.

Before embarking on my long-haul flight, I attempted to contact their customer service at to inquire about making changes. Regrettably, reaching them was quite challenging, and I endured a frustrating half-hour hold time without receiving any assistance. When it was time for my family and me to board our flight from Barcelona to Singapore, Turkish Airlines inexplicably separated us. Despite having booked our seats together as three passengers, we found ourselves scattered apart. Naturally, we voiced our discontent, as it's unreasonable to split a family on such a lengthy journey, especially after reserving specific seats. Adding to the frustration, the airline sent me numerous confusing emails with 5 days before my flight, suggesting that my seats reservation had been refunded. These emails were unclear and seemed to be plagued by technical issues, causing further anxiety and uncertainty. Furthermore, I must highlight that the customer service assistants, both in Barcelona and Istanbul, were notably rude and appeared to lack proper training. Their unhelpful demeanor and lack of responsiveness further compounded our dissatisfaction with the airline's service. It was evident that they were ill-prepared to provide the level of service one would expect from a reputable airline, leaving us with a disappointing overall experience. Upon boarding the flight, the only solution I found was to negotiate with another passenger who had been assigned the seat my wife should have been assigned. Thankfully, this person agreed to switch seats, but this situation was far from ideal. Considering that Turkish Airlines is part of the Star Alliance group, this level of service is unacceptable.

As the flight was leaving in two hours I was offered two alternatives: to downgrade myself to economy with the children with no compensation, or pay the airport upgrade price for them to travel with me in business, which I did because the staff at BCN believed Qatar would refund me as the mistake was theirs. On the return trip from HKG the check in staff had no problem with the children travelling in economy and me in business and the return trip was far easier. I was astounded by the mistakes and three months later, Qatar is still refusing me any refund or any form of compensation for the money I was forced, apparently needlessly, to spend on the outward journey so that the children could travel with me in business class.

The check-in area barely had any travelers when we arrived and we were greeted by an agent immediately. The horror began. Our ticket was a one-way ticket since we were going to Split, Croatia (our final destination) for a longer time period for us and, especially, our toddler boy (29 months old traveling with me and my wife of course) to enjoy time with family and friends. Therefore, we purchased an airline ticket for each of us and chose Singapore Airlines as a well-respected travel provider. Each of us had 2 check-in luggage, one carry-on, one backpack, and a car seat for our son. Leaving for an extended period of time with toddlers requires carrying a lot of luggage and we carefully packed it all, measured it, and tried to pay for extra weight online before flying. There was no option for it. As I was taking care of our son, my wife was checking us in at the counter (the first class counter right next to the business class counter in Row 8). I noticed that she became visibly distressed and that the agent was on the phone holding off the check-in procedure. I asked if everything was ok and she responded that the check-in agent was not letting us check in. What he and his supervisor who he was on the phone with, and who seemed to be a business class agent right next to us, said equals absolute harassment and a complete overstepping of their boundaries. They proceeded to tell us that we needed to purchase a separate return ticket each because we wonât be let in to stay in Croatia. This is unheard of, absolutely wrong, and untrue, a situation created by the agent and his supervisor that doesnât exist. I am Croatian and an American citizen, and my wife and my son are American citizens who can enter Croatia with American passports as they wish. Then, the agent (still on the phone with the next counter supervisor) asked my wife if she had at least $8000 and after taking my Croatian passport said it would be fine for me but not for my wife who never changed her name - so was asked to produce proof of our marriage. Thankfully she carries our marriage certificate in case of this but for other countries as we travel - not for the US! And this âinterrogationâ happened in an atmosphere of hostility where the agent and his supervisor, who at some point was having a laughing chat with one of his colleagues, behaved with utmost disrespect towards us as their/your client/customer. Zero courteous smile. Zero understanding. Zero any sort of empathy that we have a toddler with us. We knew that we would pay for extra weight in one piece of luggage (the 9 kg option we couldnât do online).

A380 has been in service for a while thus the seats are quite worn and despite the best maintenance it still shows, the buttons are tough to press and the inflight entertainment remote is also quite tough to be responsive; having said this they  have promised to revamp the seats soon. The seats are quite wide and when converted to a bed the upper part of the seats are wide and comfortable but the lower part where the feet lays are a bit narrow. Food was fantastic as we applied for book the cook facility. The satay was amazing and the subsequent courses did not fail to please my family. Inflight entertainment was very good but I would have loved a wider collection of not-so-recent movies. The cabin service is fantastic; cabin crew makes an effort to recognize us and even some recognized us on other flights where they were on with us on a later date.",child,0,agreed,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

My daughter passed through the gate (204) and was about to board the plane when I was withheld due to the boarding gate having been changed. The fact that my daughter was let through to the plane shows a lack of security by the ground crew at the gate, which is not acceptable. Then we were informed to proceed to gate 306.

2710,"First time flying with this airline with my family for a trip to Tokyo and back to Manila. Have to say, economy service here is better than some business class in other airlines. Tasty Japanese food, not sure if they have other menus for other routes Very polite, trained, patient and efficient crew with little to no language barrier. Seats had pretty good space with good inflight entertainment from the regular movies, episode of series but they also have current news, sports and my favorite touch, helpful how-to act, culture videos for Japan I am trying to think any negative or inconvenience and there was really none for these flights. I guess ground crew wise, there was a couple of gate switches but when I approached the ground crew they directed me promptly.

2969,"In December 2022 I travelled from Sydney to Dubai with Emirates First Class. I was contacted by the Emirates car transfer company prior to collection and informed them the number of passengers and luggage, but the car that arrived was too small and the driver was rude and unhelpful. Check-in was ok, but was not given an express pass and was directed to the business lounge not first class as available for gold members. At boarding time most of the other passengers from economy were boarded before the priority boarding due to lack of staff at the gates. After boarding I asked for my meal after take off but after 1.5 hours nothing had arrived I had to call twice before someone came to me, it took nearly another 20 min before I got my meal, As my teenage children were flying in Premier economy, I checked on them but on both occasions was rudely told to return to seat my by the same cabin crew member and on the second occasion was questioned about my seat, this was totally embarrassing. After landing in Dubai I was not able to enter the first-class lounge unless I paid $420.00 for my son for 20 min, my sons airmiles were missing at the end of the trip. I complained to Emirates about the service and after 8 weeks was told the transfer company was a third party, boarding was a strict policy, that it was my fault not to help myself to some sandwiches, policy on lounge entry, and that my son was not an air miles member (he is), No apology or mention of the cabin crew behaviour, after responding to their response I basically told by them basically Emirates did not care about my business (over $250k) per year.

6627,"San Francisco to Cape Town via Paris. We planned our yearly family trip as usual using Air France as the airline of choice. Never again!! Air France has gone down hill and we will probably never use them again. Four of us flew business class. The 1st bag Air France left behind was in San Francisco. Not lost, left behind. All bags checked in at once and somehow one bag, for a sky priority business class customer, didnt make it on the plane. Now, I can overlook the horrible food they served on our business class flight. I can even overlook the semi attentive flight crew. I canât overlook paying big dollars for priority service and instead being given the run around and lied to about our one bag! Four days later it arrived in cape town. Four days! The second leg of our trip was from Cape Town to Zurich again via Charles De Gaulle. And one bag didnât make it to Zurich. All bags checked in at the same time. In fact it appears Air France has self bag checkin now and what a mess! Itâs a totally backwards system. Cost savings by cutting employees is going to kill this airline alone. Anyhow, like I said, one bag, not lost. We know where it is. Itâs at the Charles de Gaulle airport. Four flights left Charles de Gaulle to Zurich after our flight. Still they failed to pick the bag up and place it on a new flight to Zurich. Seems simple enough. But no, in fact so difficult when you Call to follow up on the bag you literally get the most useless people on the phone who have no clue how to get the bag from point A to point B. They may as well not have a person there are al - like the baggage drop off. Four of us take two international vacations a year. Usually business class to several destinations.

1671,"Me and my daughter were in Cyprus and could not leave on our Qatar Airways return ticket from Melbourne to Larnaca due to the Covid19 lockdown. However we managed to get on a UK charter flight to Manchester via Doha to Melbourne recently. This review should really cover the Manchester to Melbourne flight via Doha. We required wheelchair assistance and medical oxygen so it was not a straight forward flight. We have so many people to thank and especially Qatar Airlines which will be the subject of the review here. Customer service was excellent. Qatar Cyprus (Eleni) reached out to us to assist us. Qatar Airways waived all charges for changing the route completely. Once they approved the wheelchair and oxygen they swung into action, we had excellent assistance from Check in to boarding and then disembarking. We were told many times that they will take care of the medical needs by the cabin crew who checked on us frequently during the flight. At Doha, we were picked up and transported to the different gates effortlessly and efficiently and were allowed to stop to get some sandwiches We have nothing but the utmost praise for the cabin crew (Flights QR 28 and QR 904 11th May 2020) for looking after us. Safety due to virus From videos to cleaning the toilets frequently and wearing the appropriate safety gear, they kept us safe during the flight. It can't be easy on the cabin crew as they are exposed to passengers all the time so they are like frontline healthcare professionals. My deep respect for the cabin crews. Qatar Airways - We will get you home (catch cry at the moment). Thank you Qatar for getting us home. Whilst most major airlines abandoned us, you kept flying. You upgraded your safety levels to manage the virus and you kept flying. You are the only major airline that kept flying to Australia. You deserve an award for this.

I went to check in online just after the 24 hour window was opened. I entered all the relevant info and managed to check in all my party, myself, my wife, my younger son 13 who has Downs Syndrome and was marked for special assistance, my elder son 17 and his friend, also 17 years old. I received the relevant confirmation in an email stating clearly that my party of 5 were all checked in and were allocated seats A to E in row 23, flight TK4330. I went to print off the boarding passes and was only able to print off mine and my elder sons but on clicking the other members of my group a message was displayed stating that boarding passes were unavailable right now but they would be available to collect at the Turkish Airlines check in desk. I tried from my laptop, my ipad using the Turkish Airlines App and my son's friends android phone again using the app. Each time I was prompted with the same message stating that each of the 3 other boarding passes would be available at the check in counter. As an IT Systems professional, this did not trigger any alarm bells, no error message was displayed and the message was very concise and clear. I also had the email confirmation. The following day when I arrived at the check in counter I was told abruptly that only myself and my elder son could board the flight and the other 3 members of my party, my wife, my sons friend and my 13 year old would have to go to the sales desk to purchase new tickets for the flight the following day. As a seasoned traveller this was the most difficult situation I had ever encountered. I politely told the Turkish Airline staff at the desk that there was no chance of that happening. I explained to them very concisely what had happened and they still very unhelpful. I showed them the email confirmation and pointed out where it clearly stated that each passenger was check in and allocated a seat. They still weren't having any of it even though I pointed out that we had special assistance for my child who was now becoming very uncomfortable and visibly upset. I told them there was no way I was going to leave my wife, child and my sons friend and asked to speak to their supervisor. It was at this point they made a few phone calls and magically found 3 seats on the packed plane. On printing the boarding passes and handing them over the staff were visibly shamed and would not make any eye contact. We later learnt that Turkish Airlines had sold our missing 3 tickets to UK travellers (at a very handsome profit) who had missed their Gatwick flight. Does it get any more disgraceful than this.

1879,"I have flown Qatar Airways several times in the last year and am a member of their loyalty program (silver). Unfortunately my last trip to Australia was absolutely awful. Delays leaving London meant a night spent in Doha but the way back was worse.  I arrived in Sydney airport with 3hrs to spare before the last night flight. There were already about 100 people waiting. Then the flight coming in was announced as cancelled. After much confusion and waiting about 20 minutes it was then changed to our flight. It turned out the incoming had been diverted to Perth with a fault to the toilet and remained in Perth because it would have been to late to arrive in Sydney. This was information not shared with us by Qatar. They sent out one person to try and talk to all passengers and most people couldnât hear him. He was getting very cross that he had to keep repeating himself. We then had to queue up to be told which hotel we were in - either the airport hotel or one back in the city centre. We queued for about and hour and a half as there were only a few people behind the counters to deal with the entire flight. They did supply a bottle of water/juice and some crackers. I was put in the city centre hotel and told to wait for a phone call or email telling me which flight I was to be put on. I endured a fairly sleepless night, waiting for the update from Qatar. In the end it was only by checking my app at breakfast that I discovered I was booked on a different airline which would take me via China and take over 30 hrs to get home. As you can imagine, I wasnât best pleased by this and when someone then phoned me (about 30 mins later), I pleaded with them to get me a different route but they werenât very sympathetic. I cadged a lift with a couple flying to Scotland who had managed to get on a flight with Qatar and went to the Qatar office to plead with them without luck. They did give me a food voucher and told me to go to the counter when the lunch time flight was leaving in the hope that some people had cancelled and I could get on, again with no luck. I remained airport side for most of the day trying to plead  to get me home earlier and quicker. At no point was I offered a different airport, e.g. Gatwick. To be fair the flights into London were very busy and I think this was the main issue with people going to the UK. I had to come back via China Southern Airlines and it was the worst experience I have had. I arrived home late Sunday evening and didnât work the following day as I was exhausted.

Checkin was easy, although I hadnât realised we could have used the Business Class counter with oneWorld Ruby status. Boarding is regimentally administered by zone. We chose the 2 abreast J/K seats on the A380 which requires walking the length of the main deck economy cabin the up the rear stairs. That small cabin at the rear of the upper deck was a good choice. Very quiet, and I like the extra storage space beside the K seat. We received a good blanket and pillow on both flights, plus a small amenity pack for the long overnight flight from SYD containing eyeshades, earplugs, sockettes, toothbrush and lip balm. Service was performed by the same crew member for the whole trip, same from Doha to Nice which I liked. The crew appeared very professional but our ladies were a little robotic. Food was adequate, with numerous drink and snack runs. I appreciated the attention to detail. Eg. asked for cranberry juice during one meal and when advised not available, was offered 3 other juice options which was fine by me. 10 minutes later, a cranberry juice was delivered. One annoying occurrence was when they changed us from 18K/19K to 19J/K from Doha, after we had been given boarding passes in Sydney. Not wanting a middle seat, the only alternative to a middle seat was an aisle further back. I think they fibbed telling us it was so a family could sit together. They werenât in row 18.

The food & beverages was really good. It seems like out of CDG the on board experience has really picked up since I last flew AF out of CDG just prior to covid. Great selections and quality along with awesome presentation. The 787 is really great for long haul. Good seats, good entertainment, quiet cabin and good amenities. Arrived in DTW approx 45 mins ahead of schedule. The bad part is the ground service. I'm sure the rush to travel now restrictions are being eased does not help, but at both LIS and CDG the boarding process is pandemonium. No-one seems to understand zoned boarding, so you literally have to fight your way through throngs of people to board at your allotted time. The paperwork for Covid related info at CDG was never addressed over the PA, but there was a table (without pens) and some papers that should be filled out, but no-one working the gate said anything until you were scanning your BP with the gate agent, so many people would then retreat back to the table and back through the line of passengers waiting to board. To cap all this, a PAX traveling with her 7 YO son was denied boarding and caused a major commotion for about 20 mins as she had been misinformed about her sons test. OK maybe this isn't on Air France, but from what she screamed to the security agents would suggest she had been given the wrong info by Air France the previous day when she was denied boarding because she didn't have the correct test to travel to USA. After getting the required test she arrived at the gate of my flight only to be denied because her son had not been tested. I know this is 100% on the passenger, but she had been misinformed about this requirement by AF the previous day in regards to her son, so certainly have some sympathy for her. Overall it added enormously to the chaos and CDG is not best equipped to have an entire widebody's load of PAX jostling and not observing any kind of distancing.

927,"London to Melbourne via Singapore. In general, the boarding process and on-board service was very good, with most flight attendants being amiable and chatty. The food was good too, apart from a very ordinary entree leaving London. However, both flights were marred by very noisy children. On the first sector (on the very quiet A380) I was in the front cabin which offers a more intimate setting. A small baby cried almost all of the trip despite attempts by his parents to pacify him. So a decent sleep was impossible. Even the supplied noise-cancelling headsets could not eliminate all of the noise, and anyway they produced a constant repetitive buzzing noise. I fully support family travel and do feel for parents who have to deal with distressed children but surely SIA could arrange for a quiet area for travellers. The sector to Melbourne was worse. I was seated in the front row of the small front cabin - with 2 rows of seats and no bassinet places. Behind me was a family of 5 with a girly toddler who screamed for most of the flight. A baby crying I can understand, but this family was generally very noisy and seemed unaware that they were sharing the cabin with other passengers. There seemed to be no attempt by cabin staff to try to improve the situation, even though their exchanged looks indicated that they were aware of the noise. Added to that, the cabins of the un-upgraded B777-300ER's are becoming quite shabby and worn, and the IFE systems are behind the times. Because of the noisy fellow travellers I have to downgrade my ratings for these flights. It is a pity, because SIA are reliable, honour seat allocations and the staff are generally very good. Maybe I was unlucky, but my trip home was not as good as I expected.",child,0,agreed,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
5527,"At check-in in Johannesburg, I was told we could not board unless my wife and children had return tickets. They have EU Family visas and no return ticket is required. We were forced to purchase 3 tickets that were not needed at a cost of R27,000. The flight was delayed almost one hour due to a technical problem. Due to this delay we missed the connecting flight to Toulouse. Turkish Airlines staff were incredibly unhelpful and uncaring. The sales desk demanded I buy new tickets at a price of R40,000 ($2,800) and I refused. Customer service was pathetic. The helpline from the sales desk needed a Turkish speaker to understand the process. I was on the phone for over 30 minutes twice explaining what had happened, and was told to to wait a few hours. They would call or email me; but there is no free WiFi or cell phone signal in the arrival terminals. I checked in every couple hours for 12 hours.  The sales desk said they could not give me free connecting flights as the flight was full and the cost was R40,000 ($2,800). They could give me next day tickets to Paris, which is at least 8 hours drive from my destination.  Istanbul airport staff in general were a nightmare to speak to in English, with an attitude of indifference. They were callous and rude at every encounter even though I was friendly, polite and upbeat. From 6 am until 2pm we had no access to proper food or drinks, except pretzels and sweets from a kiosk.  We slept in the airport on the benches - my wife and I with two hyper active kids aged 6 and 8. It was a nightmare. Waited 24 hours before the next flight, and 12 of those hours we were anxious and traumatized by the situation and staff. Arrived in Paris next day, only to find baggage had not been forwarded. This after I had discussed how the baggage worked. I saw the consultant print the new baggage tags and make changes on the system. Filled in the missing baggage report at the airport. Baggage arrived 5 days later by courier. Broken. The telescopic handle was broken off and the hard case was cracked about 15 cm. A soft case had holes in from friction. I've reported this to customer service and received no response except an automated message.  I've attempted to claim compensation on the baggage delay, but the website form doesn't work. We came from super hot summer in South Africa to - 2 degree winter and needed to buy new shoes, jackets and other basics for 4 people at a cost of $800. The airline has made no attempt to contact me or to redress the damages. When things go wrong in Istanbul, you might as well be on another planet where nobody cares at all about you or your family's well-being, and put profit before customer service. I will never fly Turkish Airlines again.",child,0,llm_validated,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Desserts definitely the highlight, I counted 45 different desserts on one evening. Overall good quality and variety.  For kids - plenty of pools and slides for kids. Beach is walking distance away. Plenty of activities for kids to keep them entertained For Muslim visitors - although Turkey being a Muslim country its almost impossible to avoid cross contamination with alcohol on drinks glasses, cutlery and plates. The same people who serve the alcohol are the ones setting up the tables. Your glasses, plates, table or cutlery will almost definitely have come in contact with alcohol. 90% of the adults there are alcohol drinkers. There is no prayer room as far as I could tell but you can request prayer mats to your room. The bedroom bar will have lager and wine. There are no issues in wearing a burkini. They have a separate spa if women would like a Turkish bath or massage in a private room (subject to availability).   Negatives - everything is overpriced. Massages, hair cuts, excursions, taxis, shops, extra activities etc. All more expensive than what you would pay in the UK. Expect to have your pants pulled down, so buy everything you need from your own country. They work on Euros, pounds and dollars here, nothing is priced in liras. They only currency exchange £20 maximum at the hotel reception. You will have to catch a taxi to a currency exchange shop if you need more. But all the places accept euros, dollars and pounds so liras aren&#39;t necessary. When you book a taxi to do shopping they will take you to shops where they earn a commission from. We asked for a taxi at the hotel they said it would cost €75, we downloaded the gettransfer.com app and we paid £30 for a taxi. That&#39;s how much of a difference it is.  When we checked in at 12.30am, they didn&#39;t even ask us if we were hungry or gave welcome drinks.   In conclusion, in conclusion I do think its a very good hotel and good value for money for families with young children. Outside of the hotel is better than inside. Bedrooms definitely need updating. I will give it a 7.5 out 10. If they stopped trying to rip you off with extras at every given opportunity I would have given it a 8.5.",child,1,agreed,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

The bathroom faucets are not appropriate for those sinks. The faucet barely hangs over the bowl. You have to basically shove your hands against the sink bowl just wash your hands. Washing your face would be a trainwreck. The occasional loud noises from the nearby road can be startling.

We booked a two-bedroom suite and were lucky enough to be allocated pool-access rooms (interconnecting) - the pool next to the rooms was separate from the main pool, which meant it wasn&#39;t busy with strangers right outside your door, but being able to step out and straight into water was fantastic, especially for the kids.  The main pool is heated and lovely, and breakfast was plentiful (if lacking a bit in variety).  Wifi access and speed was great, and they have a laundry room on site, which was very handy. The rooms are in desperate need of maintenance - our showerheads spurted water in all directions and one was almost breaking, one phone did not work whilst it was barely possible to hear on the other, drainage in one shower was questionable.

Opposite Miramar shopping centre Sea views Spa (additional charge, very common for this region) Huge spacious rooms Hot water, good pressure. Excellent soundproofed rooms Good WiFi on 4th floor.  We went during the off season in January, extensive and beautiful Christmas decorations in the hotel.Would recommend as a family hotel for a laid-back family, not looking for entertainment  just a nice setting where kids can play by the beach, adults can relax, or a couple looking to get away to a quiet, beautiful location for a few days.   Negatives- Gym - very basic and very hot&#47;windows facing sun with no Aircon. No good local places to eat you need to go into fuengirola (15 min drive - not an issue if you are driving&#47;taxis) With so many restaurants, we were surprised to find nowhere to eat in the hotel between 16:00 and 19:30. We wanted to eat in the tapas restaurant (closed) or in the lobby bar&#47;lobby balcony and were told we could only eat a burger, ham and cheese sandwich or order from the more varied room service menu which can only be eaten in the room (not served in lobby bar&#47;balcony or anywhere else in hotel) + costs an additional charge of 12 Euros on top of order. It was also very quiet we were one of two guests in the lobby bar at the time so felt they could have made an exception so we could eat in the hotel and enjoy the hotel surroundings, we ended up eating in Miramar shopping centre instead and never got the chance to use the hotel restaurants apart from the buffet as we only stayed one night&#47;half board.  Easy win for the hotel would be changing the shower heads to rainfall showers to upgrade experience. Generally not happy with the lack of food choices for dinner, but it was tasty.

You pay 4 star you get 4 star food. The hotel is lovely and clean and staff are happy to help. I would definitely recommend this hotel to people with young families its great. The town around is very Spanish (which is what i like), there is not much nightlife, if that&#39;s what you are looking for you wont find it in Pineada but we went with the kids so this didn&#39;t bother us. There is a few lovely restaurants in the town and down the road in Callella. The only thing i would say is that there are not enough sunbeds in the hotel for the amount of people that stay there. You have to get down to the pool around half 8 to get a sunbed. The rooms are a bit on the small side if you have a big family but they are very clean and nice and modern. The room for the entertainment in the night is very very hot but it is August so its expected and there are a lot of people that stay in the hotel. This did not affect our holiday in any way but i think people should know before they go. Also they have a cocktail menu with cocktails you have to pay for and certain drinks you have to pay for but I think that&#39;s the same in most hotels now. If you are all inc you get the drinks you have to pay for at half price. We didn&#39;t pay for many drinks at all maybe the odd cocktail. Also If you re-use your bath towels you will collect water points which you can hand in and get free cocktails and other drinks. I think its 6 tokens for a free cocktail. i used all mine at the end of my holiday so that was good.",child,1,agreed,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

Staff were really friendly and one of the staff members really made a fuss of our baby which was sweet. We would definitely stay again.

Bathroom with hair dryer, gel etc. Nice terrace with chairs and table and lot of flowers and greenery around. I liked the fact that every room had a clothes rack.  Fedon is an absolute great host. He is a friendly and helpful guy. Gave us tips &amp;suggestion to visit places in Crete. Catherina, sweet and pleasant who kept the place clean. Fedons son, Andres knew exactly what the guest wanted for breakfast. We truly enjoyed our stay here. I would recommend this place but keep in mind its not a luxury apartment. The swimming pool is not in the premises. It is outside 2-3mins walk, but a public recreational pool. It is meant for small kids. So you don&#39;t feel too comfortable. You cannot take your own food there, you have to purchase from the bar inside. And also pay for the slides.   There was a small window in the bathroom which when opened would bring in the gutter smell from outside and fill up the room if it the room was unoccupied. And if we kept it closed, the humidity in the bathroom built up. They should install an exhaust.   Breakfast was the same everyday-bread, boiled eggs, ham, cheese, butter and jam.

Food choices were usually good, drinks available whenever we wanted and the evening entertainment usually fine.  Overall all of us were happy with our choice of hotel. There were a few minor issues which could be improved upon:  - the evening meal didn&#39;t start until 7:00pm.  This was late for the children and seemingly for most people as the restaurant was rammed from 7 - 8:30.  A 6:30 or earlier would be better  - the evening meal finished at 9:30. If you came in just before that there was food available till 9:30 but then it was all cleared away and the lights were turned off.

In the end we quite like the rooms because they were communicating and the girls could go from our room to them all the time. Also the staff was very sorry and they gave us 4 free drinks.Our radiator was broken so it was quite cold also because the little portable radiator was not strong enough.  Also, plugs were on the only table, so we ended up having the radiator on the table. In my parents&#39; room the light in the toilet wasn&#39;t working so they couldn&#39;t close the toilet door.

The electric blankets and split system heater were fantastic at keeping us warm (there was also another heater that we didn’t use overnight).  The shared bathroom facility (shared with one other room) was really wonderfully set up and no problem for this family of 4.  We used the kitchen briefly- also we’ll set up.   Other people were staying at the temple, but we didn’t see them.  The location is close to restaurants and food places and all that Takayama has to offer. Limit of 1 Hour for bathroom booking for a family of 4 per stay felt a bit rushed - esp. given it had a lovely big bath to use. Wasn’t clear if we could split our time and book a slot in the morning also- which would be handy for those who wanted to freshen up in morning before departure (ie. 40 mins at night, 20 mins in morning) .

Relatively new (2014) and very well maintained and clean building along with the surrounding gardens and the large beach with very fine sand. Great and huge outdoor pool under the nicely looking bridges and heated indoor&#47;outdoor pool for swimming&#47;relaxing at the end of the day. Spacious enough (58 sq. m) and comfortable family rooms, the spring mattress beds are hard but I personally liked them, some other people didn&#39;t.  Very well organized main restaurant with more than enough food variety and good quality corresponding to the mid-range category&#47;pricing. I really appreciate that they try to offer different theme nights every day of the week. Dublin bar… a place where you can watch football… among friends… on a big screen… Priceless!  Snacks, street and beach bars all offer good alternatives for lunch and the “Wunderbar” is great for live music events in the evening.  Most of the staff is very nice and helpful and will do anything to make you enjoy every minute of your stay, this is another very strong point of this resort, the staff is great. Magic Life App will help you to organize your day and book most of the activities you want to participate. There is Wi-fi Internet connection everywhere including the beach and is overall usable. No hotel (or anything else) is perfect and there is always room for improvement but out stay in Jacaranda was unexpectedly unforgettable. So, the negatives that I list here are mostly minor complains or are about additional services that didn’t really affect our holiday, hence the top rating.  All of the rooms have windows in the bathroom which, of course, is pointless. Moreover, the roller blind doesn’t cover the window completely and the main bedroom gets illuminated at night, so it’s also stupid. Not to mention that this window is totally out of place in a family room… The synthetic fiber pillows that you get in the room are probably the cheapest and worst possible pillows which barely offer any support and are all clumped. These pillows have no place in any hotel, ever, anywhere.  The desserts in the main restaurant are often too large, which contributes to unnecessary wasting, and I would rather focus more on the taste than the look as many of the them are way too overdecorated, but no so eatable. This is something that is noticeably worse than other resorts in Antalya. The so-called “specially restaurants’’ in Jacaranda are a real shame. They don’t offer anything special as an atmosphere, the menus are very limited and most importantly the food is mediocre and very amateur work, not comparable to the level of the main restaurant. In my opinion, it’s far better to offer something like Jacaranda Lounge for additional price rather than a number of free restaurants which are complete joke and only spoil the otherwise excellent experience. MAGIC APPetite is actually a great idea where you vote for certain dishes and then you see them as a mini three-course menu at the next dinner. Again, а great idea, but unfortunately killed by very poor and amateur execution.  Aquapark is old with a few slides that won’t impress anyone, many of the hotels in Antalya already upgraded their waterparks with the modern constructions, which would be a great addition here.",child,0,disputed,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

619371,"Very large bedroom with air conditioning. Modern facilities. The housekeeper was very accommodating although there was a language barrier (particularly when it comes to money) as he doesn&#39;t speak English so we spoke via Google translate. They did my laundry on request. Muhamad and his sons own the hotel and Muhamad was very welcoming, he knocked on my door on the morning after my arrival and took me on a full day private tour of Egypt at an additional cost of $250 USD (not including tips). A simple continental breakfast is provided at a time you request (bread, cheese, ham, a boiled egg). Nice balcony view of the garden. Very peaceful place as it&#39;s in a private compound away from the streets. It is not a hotel but rather a guarded compound whereby you stay in a house with other guests and a housekeeper and you get your own private bedroom and ensuite which is lockable (the rest of the house is shared living space). There is no reception and the housekeeper takes photos of your passport on his phone (for security purposes) on arrival, which gets sent to all of the hotel owners&#39; phones (not an overly secure form of storing people&#39;s information). From a cleanliness point of view I could see other people&#39;s hairs in the bed linen and the fridge had small spots of mould so I didn&#39;t use it. The shower is in a tall bath with no shower screen, so water floods the tiles and it is quite slippery (would be dangerous for people with mobility issues). Need to catch taxi&#39;s&#47;private transport to get anywhere as the inn is in a more secluded area of Egypt away from the city and it is a 1 hour drive to the airport. No swimming pool.

We have a Romanian wording ”împinge tava”  = ”push the tray” for the usual daily menu we can get at all bistro...any menu was much better than what we have got in the resort... Quantity of food insufficient, it happened many times to go there, no matter if 19.30 or 20.30, to find that the pots for food were empty...and it took 15-30 minutes until they have been re-filled...if they have... Within the first 2-3 days of staying when we asked for a drink during the dinner we were told to pay cash because ”the system” = pay on the room was not working... Not sufficient people on the main restaurant to prepare tables&#47;to clean, but too many to smile when you get into the main restaurant or to do things which could be resolved in a far better manner: instead of asking the room number every evening, to find out if we have half board, all inclusive or else, they can give you a bracelet on different colors to separate...

It is a bit far from the city center and it is hard to get to the center as the city is really crowded. If you plan to visit Istanbul and spend time on the other side of the Bosphorus bridges, I would recommend another stay.

1524070,"When you book here, you get access to the private island where the flamingos live. Tickets there for non guests are around $135? So if you utilize going to this beautiful island, you get your money&#39;s worth from this hotel. I highly recommend doing it!   The hotel had a lot of shopping, dining, casino, and access to 3 pools. We stayed at the adults only section of the hotel, and the pool was nice but much smaller than the one at the family-friendly one. The family-friendly one had a swim up bar, so be sure to go there as well.  The hotels are in the heart of Orjanstead, so you can easily walk to other restaurants and bars. The hotel is expensive, in my opinion, if you don&#39;t utilize the island option. The room is small (but modern), and the breakfast included was very mediocre. I&#39;ve stayed at other Renaissance Hotels worldwide, and they&#39;ve done better with the rooms and breakfasts. We had some great experiences with some staff half the time, while the other half of the time, the staff seemed stressed&#47;too busy.",child,0,agreed,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

499160,There were two complaints from us 1 The first night we arrived late in the evening and asked the staff about a place to dine nearby The guy pointed to the one that they advertise which was far far away from the hotel We walked for 10 mins with a toddler but still weren t even close the that place So we settled for one of the many places along the route The strange thing is that there were other streets with other options he could have pointed us to and save us time and effort 2 The air conditioning did not work properly Even if set to max cold it was blowing slightly warm air When we called the reception they changed something but the issue then was that even when set to max heat it was blowing cold air All through our stay we had to call them 3 to 4 times just to get the AC adjusted Then why have the dials in the room at all   The staff was very helpful Initially we were given a room which was attached to the bedroom of the next room and our son was poorly on the first day so he was noisy the first day Our neighbours didn t like this and came to us to complain We immediately reported it and were given another room by the staff later that day The staff made it clear that our neighbours had no right to complain to us directly and should have contacted them in the first place They also said that they have a policy to not give such room to families with young children but something went wrong in the booking process The breakfast was also excellent,child,1,agreed,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

364542,First gripe the TINY lift My daughter refused point blank to get in it with me and our two suitcases to be fair it would have been a tight squeeze We actually only ever used it going up to our room on the third floor with shopping we always came down on the stairs BUT it is vital for those checking out for bringing heavy luggage down to reception I found that in the mornings it was often blocked with individual guests using it to go down for breakfast while other guests were left waiting on landings with luggage Second gripe breakfast Breakfast was included in the deal I got for our stay so this gripe is NOT personal and to be honest we decided beforehand to have breakfast each day on our way to whatever attraction we had planned most in London open at 10 00 The hotel breakfast is a continental one and this is advertised as such the dining area is small and there is an obvious rush hour at peak times so I would be very annoyed if I actually had to pay for it I would go down between 07 30 and 08 00 and just take an orange juice and coffee to the bar to read the news online many times there were people complaining about the wait to get tables or the lack of food when they got there When in London you are never far away from a proper English breakfast for a very reasonable price Location was what sold this hotel to me   Fantastic location 5 out of 5 so close by foot or by public transport to many London attractions Across the road from Hyde Park 30 min walk nice relaxed pace to Oxford Street or Harrods 30 min walk at a slightly faster pace to Madame Tussauds Bus to London Zoo right outside the door Tube and bus station Lancaster Gate across the road Rooms are in need of refurbishing for sure but the beds were comfortable and the bath towels were so big and fluffy I have had worse in some 5 star hotels The outdoor terrace is beautiful really nice and sunny The bar is small but well set out big screen TV and a wide choice of drinks The staff were for the most part very polite and helpful it can get a bit manic around 10 00 11 00 when load of people are trying to check out at the same time and also around 15 00 with check ins We stayed for three nights so I witnessed this on arrival and on leaving but that is to be expected Otherwise the staff were excellent providing help with directions maps tips and tricks and they are very accommodating for holding baggage for arriving before the room is ready guests and those who have checked out but want a last minute shopping spree without dragging large suitcases with them,child,0,llm_validated,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

191770,The painful experience started with charging full 3 nights GBP1000 for my business partner room despite it was cancelled more than 2 days before check in date due to emergency trip cancellation death in the family Front desk instead of finding a solution to refund the unjustified room charged she put the blame on booking com and told me its there policy which doesn t make sense because Booking com is an e commerce intermediary platform and they don t collect room charges for themselves That was my response then the front desk lady she promised to discuss this matter with higher management and get back to me which never happened No one even bothered to contact me about the subject very bad I felt like been fooled When I checked in my room I discovered a serious security defect in the balcony door it can t close from inside the fixed key is misplaced outside the balcony door and balcony is shared with other rooms so its an easy access from the outside Of course I informed the front desk and the show started each personnel started to throw the blame on somebody else security contractors house keeping quality check it was a nightmare eventually I proposed a solution for them by removing the fixed key from outside the door which ultimately was done On different subject room service I used to leave my room very early for meetings and came back after 5 PM surprisingly my room wasn t serviced so I had to call the housekeeping to make up my room Funny enough on my last day was the weekend the housekeeping came at 8 AM and woke me up despite the sign of do not disturb was hanging outside my door as usual lots of apologies Also the room itself is nicely designed but poorly engineered the bathroom lights switch misplaced by the entrance of the room so if you need to switch ON the lights in the bathroom you have to go all the way to the opposite side of the room   new clean hotel,child,0,llm_validated,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

We are a family of two adults and two children and were accommodated straight away on a busy Saturday night in France. There is a lively and bustling ( but non intimidatory) atmosphere at The Frog and the service was completely excellent. The waiters and waitresses are extremely busy but always have time for you and are always smiling and polite. One dark haired waitress had the type of smile that super models would die for! We didn't have to wait long for food. We had 2 x nachos for starters - excellent, good to see them being served with jalapeños as well- and 4 x various burgers ( inc. veggie ) for main meals. Again, could not fault these either. Basically, had a very good night at The Frog.  Beers, excellent and there was a really good choice.  Don't expect Bistro type drinks or food as this, as mentioned earlier, is a French type of Wetherspoons. The main difference though is excellent waiters, better beers, better food , better clientele and a superior atmosphere. No rowdiness, bad language or obese underdressed hen party- goers. Funny how they can get it right in the continent? The place is huge yet we never felt crowded. If in Bercy Village then The Frog has to be a must try place. Highly recommended is The Frog.

This time we were traveling with our one-year-old child and the last place wasn't the nicest so I decided to spend a little more money to try to get something a little nicer. Wrong. It's an old fashioned drive-up motor lodge. Our room smelled so strongly of bleach when we arrived, I wondered what that smell was covering up. I had a partial answer soon after when I opened the curtains to discover a pair of dirty mens underwear on the floor behind them. The sliding glass door didn't lock other than a big wooden stick which didn't leave me with a lasting sense of security. Speaking of security, none of the keys worked right. The key to open the door to the hallway and the room both required a considerable amount of jiggling to free the lock. I feel badly for anyone stayed near the outside door as it slammed behind with huge BOOM. The TV was one of the old-school standard def models from 20 years ago and was pretty representative the place in general. It was probably last renovated many years ago and it's very tired now. They installed a drop ceiling in the bathroom and for some reason the tub was about a foot off the ground which left my head about an inch from the ceiling.

There were children running around all hours of the night and day and the hotel staff did nothing to keep them quiet. Our first night there we had a family above us with small children who kept running around the room and because of the noise we assume they were jumping off the furniture. We complained to the hotel staff and nothing was done to stop this. It continued until well after 11 PM and night.The second night we were there, we had a family with small children next door to us and it was apparent from what we saw, they were there with other families who also had small children. They were kept there doors open and the children were running up and down the balcony with no supervision. At 6 AM the next morning, someone was pounding on the door next to us very loudly and yelling fire, fire, fire. It woke up the people next to us so they opened there door and began to play loud rap music until about approximately 9 AM when we left. We were on the second floor near the office and all of this activity was extremely loud and had to have been heard at the office, but no action was taken to stop it.I would never stay at this hotel again!!!!Thank you for taking the time to write us a review.

However I choose this hotel because of the name and it did not meet the standards that I'm use to when staying at a Wingate Hotel and for the price it truely did not match. The pictures looked better online than in person. The door to the hotel room did not open properly, the toilet was very loose and when me or the kids sat on it, it shook - the tub was not properly cleaned so we used the towels to put down on the bottom of the tub. The money I spent on the room did not match the quality of the hotel's name which is why I choose it. For what we got we could have stayed at a motel 6 for a approximately half the price.

I think the price can be a bit high, we only stay if we get a good deal and so try to book early and with a AAA discount.The grounds are beautiful, it feels like a Hacienda. The pool is fairly large as is the jacuzzi. There's nice lounge chairs and it never seems too crowded. A good mix of young, old, families, business people having conferences, etc...No one will feel out of place. It is on the quite/reserved side though so I'm not sure how much kids would like it. We usually stay here with our teenagers when we're doing something in San Diego or La Jolla (water skiing, snorkeling, etc...) otherwise I think they would be a bit bored too.Food is fairly expensive, we usually try to do the Mustang's happy hour and then eat out other meals. I don't think I would recommend the food if we paid the full price vs. happy hour prices. The lengua tacos were fabulous as were the chicken wings. Moscow Mule was delicious, but it was strange they ran out of copper mugs. The bar/restaurant was very empty but they had to take our mugs from us at the table and refill for the second round. Service was friendly and fast.Rooms are comfortable, this time we stayed in basic room and didn't have a balcony which I missed. It's pretty to sit out and view their landscaping/fountains, etc..It feels very secluded. They provide you with a bottle of wine in the room which is a nice touch.Gym isn't large but has what you need- about 7 or 8 cardio machines, a few weight machines and free weights. It got a little full, but we were able to do our full routines both days with no issues.There were just a couple of negatives: self parking is so expensive at 25.00 a day. I really wish hotels would just add that in to the nightly room fee along with the resort fees. Each night ends up being 50 more when you add in extras like being able to park your car. Also they offered free coffee/tea service in the mornings but from like 5-6:30 a.m. in the morning which is insane. Who wakes up at 5 in the morning on vacation Either offer the coffee/tea at a normal time which is a minimal cost to the hotel and garners good will to guests or take it away.Dear bakeshop,Thank you for being a frequent and loyal guest at Estancia we're thrilled to be your hotel of choice when visiting the San Diego area.

Coffee is about 4 and decent. Overall i was happy with my stay but when we were checking out, I went to the front desk to confirm my balance and to close my account. I was told my balance was 40, which was right due to 15 parking and some coffee I ordered. Two days later, I see there is a credit card charge on my account for over 1000! The room was prepaid AND I made sure to check my account before leaving. So I have no clue what happened with this. I have left a message and awaiting for a call back to rectify this. The worse part is that I was charged the exchange rate for that day and foreign fee on my credit card when there should have never been this charge in the first place! So in regards for billing I dont know what to say. I would have said make sure billing is right before checking out but apparently that doesnt make a difference as I made sure of my final bill before I left to only be charged 1000. Aloha Mmark 8,Mahalo nui loa for your review. I believe we have your billing error all worked out. We apologize for falling short of our expectations with up to the minute billing.

When we got our room we noticed a few problems: the futon bed/sofa had both back legs broken or detached. When my kids sat on it they nearly fell back into the wall. When I told the from desk they just put a roll away bed in the room (which you could feel every spring through). The shower faucet was falling off the wall as well. When I reported to the front desk they just didnt seem to care. When I called down for linen for the toll away bed they told me to come get it myself- because only one worker on duty.

But, it's a resort with lots of young families, so if you're looking for a quiet time by the pool, not gonna happen, although the plunge pool area is noticeably quieter. I don't get why you need a card for towels and you have to sign for reclining chairs at the beach where you have to place a tag. The Westin next door has a bar and casual dining that is closer to the ocean, which we preferred. You can use your room card to charge at any of the adjacent Westin properties which was good.The rooms, which are called villas for whatever reason are very nice, great bathrooms, very comfy beds, kitchens are very functional. The doors to the rooms all slam shut, which was bothersome.You will get asked nice and politely, several times to take a timeshare tour, you can't miss the tours , they are going on al day in a certain pattern like the jungle cruise at Disneyland.

792,"We come to New Orleans multiple times a year. We normally stay at another chain of hotels but our normal arrangements were booked full. This is our first time at this particular hotel and staying with this chain. The positives are this hotel is nice, very updated, we found our 2 bedroom suite to be very spacious, very clean, and the offerings for the food choices of the happy hour and breakfast exceeded our expectations. The front desk staff were very kind and helpful. They even assisted me to book needed activities for our family. The negatives are this establishment is ran so tightly it is at the expense of the comfort of its customers. The happy hour requires you to keep up with a card per adult to ensure you receive no more than 3 beverages. The happy hour offerings are of course well drinks and cheap wine. My husband accidentally spilled his last glass of wine at the bar and the employee made mention he was exceeding the allowable amount of beverage as he begrudgingly replaced it. The air conditioner is fixed to not go below 70 F. Our entire family was extremely uncomfortable and sweated all night. The tubs are fixed to only allow showers. There are not individual toiletries. Instead there is a shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser attached to the wall. It kind of grossed me out to think every other naked person before had touched it during their shower. They do advertise to earn so many reward points for everyday you do not utilize housekeeping so that leads me to believe this is a brand/chain initiative. It's a nice hotel that is uncomfortable and that's just unfortunate. My husband's review was, It's like being a guest of a cheapskate.",child,0,llm_validated,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
4466,"Location, location, location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 211. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!",child,0,agreed,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

6431,"My son and I stayed here one night to have a look at Tulane. We could see in advance that it was a good value. When we arrived, being Platinum, they offered us the opportunity to stay in a 3rd floor balcony room. What was also impressive is they alerted us in advance that it would be noisy and gave us the option to take a courtyard room. We decided, not getting to NOLA often, to get stay in the balcony room. We had a great view of the passers by and street entertainment all night and it was great that as we got hungry we could just walk out of the hotel and within a few blocks are some really good restaurants. We were there on a Sunday night and the drums were pounding loudly until 4 am. I learned two things from it 1) this hotel room came equipped with two sets of earplugs (which we did not use) and 2) I was so tired I slept ok even with all the noise.To sum up, very good staff, great location, good value. It is true that a Bourbon street-side room is not for everyone. If loud noise most of the night is a big problem, just ask for a courtyard room. But is you want the unique view of Bourbon Street, the balcony rooms give you the best view in the city. If you use the earplugs or noise cancellation, you will be fine.Thank you Havasupai123 for providing your feedback on your stay with us.

Whilst checking in I didnt feel the usual Ritz welcome service I had experienced in other Ritz Hotels. We made our way up to a very pleasant room with a Cava chilling and selection of chocolates and a birthday card welcome which was a lovely touch to the start of our vacation. Our room was not quite ready as the put up bed had not been set up, our arrival was approximately 8pm so I would have thought this would have been done. We hit the shops ( Black Friday). On returning to the hotel all was done. We continued to enjoy our stay at the Ritz which an amazing setting in an ideal location. The doormen where very attentive as we were in and out and nothing was to much trouble for them.Getting ready to go out on Sunday evening I realised an item of jewellery was missing. Security initially could not do enough and we were given access to Club Lounge as we needed to hang around the hotel more than we wanted to to help with investing the incident. Not ideal when we only had a 5 day stay. However, after 24 hours and the item was never found I felt like we were under suspicion. We never heard anything from Security again. Police took statements. On arrival back to the UK we have had to contact Ritz to find out any outcome of their investigation and are still no further on.

We visited Orlando this week and needed a place to stay near Universal without breaking the bank. This hotel received numerous good reviews and the price was right, so we booked for 3 nights. To me, service makes all the difference, because most hotel rooms are generic. We are a family of four, and two Queen beds used to work just fine. My son is now twelve and is getting too big to sleep with. While at the front desk, we asked Alain if we could have some extra blankets to make a pallet for our son. He started tapping on his computer and I'm thinking why does he need to look on the computer to give us more blankets'. Turns out he was giving us the suite next to our existing room for no extra charge. My son felt like he had his own little apartment! Way to go Alain!

The location is great, with shopping every way you turn. While my husband was in business meetings, I kept myself busy roaming the stores in the area. It is an easy walk to Pike's Place Market, which is a must-see experience! So many awesome vendors with unique items to sell. It's the only place I have ever found something personalized with the correct spelling of my daughter's name. :) It was my first visit to Seattle, and I had a wonderful time. The hotel was perfect in every way. I would recommend to all.Thank you for your review. It sounds like you had a great time! It's wonderful that you were able to find all the great places to shop and visit while your husband was in meetings we always hope to accommodate all of our guests whether they are here for leisure or business or both!

Went out for family dinner menu is not huge but has something to satisfy everyoneâs taste buds provided you are a non vegetarian. For starters tried the fish grill and Lebanese juicy chicken. It was one of the best fish dishes Iâve tasted in town, Iâm particular about my fish, not much bones or fins, should not Smell bad and should be cooked well, all 3 criteria was a tick with a wonderful flavour and the accompanying mayo sauce was just perfect. High standards set with first dish, expectations were only growing as we waited for Lebanese chicken , it was just juicy , cooked well and was fresh and tasted great. So a 5 on 5 for starters. Now moving to the the attraction of the day, the Mandi it was authentic Middle East preparation, with tangy spicy gravy accompaniments, ordered juicy mutton Mandi, mutton quality was above par, Mandi was great , if you are a spice lover, Mandi is not for you.

As I'm Sheraton/ Marriot Platinum member (42216744521/791050313) and had the best experience in past, I thought this would be a good choice. We booked the table. We started the food but soon we realized that we have made the worst decision of our life ever for restaurant selection. We opted to go with Buffet. There is definitely a great variety on the menu but the food was cold, not even warm. I did not like the food much. It was not even okay. As you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from Sheraton, that was not the case here. Only real-time cooked food was hot like pasta, roti. Anyway, we finished our food and came back. Now in the night, my younger son started vomiting and he was finding difficulties to digest water as well. The whole night he was vomiting. And, in the morning my wife stared do vomiting. We rushed to the hospital [Continatal] and the doctor clearly said it is food poising.

He appears healthy, but is not — and has a German Shepherd service dog that lives with us (Lt. Dan). Over the last few years, we’ve traveled and taken the dog on every sort of transportation — planes, trains, boats, you name it. We go to amusement parks with him fairly often. He’s a pro. We thought we had the disability travel thing down with the dog, but then… …my older son (34) was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrigs’ disease) this year. That put us on a fairly urgent “check-off-the-bucket list” journey. He now uses a wheelchair and has almost no use of hands and feet. His needs change almost weekly so we can’t plan too far in advance. Our first big outing was a week at Disneyland because my 3rd child (a daughter) works for the company (yay discounts!). Can you imagine our family of five, with a wheelchair, and a service dog, at Disneyland in JULY? Yup, we are THAT family. I used to think people who did that sort of thing were crazy, but now I understand. Wheelchair travel is new to me, so I’m here hoping to learn about that.

It’s not really safe for the animals and not conducive for other members but we have to accommodate because of the ADA standards. My complaint is people who come in with service dogs that are not service dogs. We know that, anyone can get a service dog vest on Amazon. This one member comes in with a tiny little dog that weighs one and 1/2 pounds in a faux service dog vest! This seems disrespectful to the upstanding citizens, who actually have a service dog that helps them.

5358,"I made a reservation for a pet from New York JFK to Baku via Istanbul. I was advised by Turkish Airlines representatives to make a reservation for the cat on the flight with Jet Blue. However, when I called Jet Blue to make a reservation for my pet from Sacramento to JFK, I was told that the airlines never does this. And it is not allowed. Turkish Airlines representatives should have this information for travelers, as it is very difficult in the first place to make a pet reservation on Turkish Airlines. I called the Call center, and was told by a representative how to change my reservation. I did this, but there was an error in the booking that could not be changed, and I no longer had a booking for this flight, even though I was not offered any refund or further help. I was told that this case would be reported to customer service, and was given a number. I called the customer service back, and was not helped at all. I also emailed several offices, in both San Francisco and New York, and received no response whatsoever. After one week, I was told that they would put my case on priority status, that it would be handed within 48 hours. After 9 days, Turkish airlines has failed To address this situation. And this mistake - which their representatives created - has not been addressed or rectified. This is the worst service I have ever received from any airline that Ã¬ have ever made a reservation with. I am extremely dissatisfied, as I have no longer have any way to reserve any ticket for myself and a pet in cabin on the airline.",pet,1,agreed,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

I was so upset but I decided to find another airline and when I asked for my money back they told me they canât give me it all back and kept $1300 for penalties. It wasnât my fault they booked me with my dog then decided to change the aeroplane. They are horrible stealing from people when itâs their fault they changed the aeroplane size and now left me with -1300 on my card and having to find a new aeroplane in a week that would take my dog.

1822,"My journey with Qatar was an adventure. I was flying out with my dog, a native Sri Lankan dog (breed was mixed/mongrel) and it was a nightmare to book. To be fair, it wasn't bad the first time - mixed breed was okay. Unfortunately I had to change the date of my flight and rebook my dog onto the flight, and that's where the nightmare began. The staff wanted to know what breed my dog was, despite my dog not having a breed at all. I called them on a Friday about the dog, they said I would hear from them within 48 hours. That following Wednesday I had to call them because I hadn't heard anything yet, only to find out they never processed the dog in the first place and my flight was that Sunday! Despite not having any problems with ""mixed breed"" the first time, I had loads of problems now. Mixed breed wasn't okay, despite stating it definitely wasn't one of the dogs not allowed to fly. Mongrel wasn't okay either. I eventually got approved just over a day before the flight. It was an absolute nightmare to deal with - but from others I heard that Qatar was one of the easiest airlines to deal with for pet transport, and no one had any problems so far (there have been hundreds of Sri Lankan dogs transported with Qatar before this problem). The flight itself wasn't bad. We departed Colombo on time, staff were great during check in and checking my and my dog's documents was really easy - the manager was even excited to see my dog, and her and another staff member dedicated their time to me, in my own queue. The staff on the plane were nice too, both from Colombo-Doha and Doha-Amsterdam and assured me my dog was okay, even checking with the pilot to make sure the dog was on the flight and the pilot was aware of the dog. The flight itself was comfortable, good movie selections too. The only thing that bothered me was a lack of legroom on my Doha-Amsterdam flight, because the row in front of us had 4 seats and our row had 3 seats, leaving less space for me because of the seat in front of me. Me and the dog arrived safely and they even changed the dog's bedding during the layover, so I'm happy about that. If it wasn't for the nightmare of booking my dog onto the flight, it would've been great.",pet,1,agreed,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

A little out from Selfoss but so quiet and homely, suited us perfectly. Julia is a delightful, helpful host. She has a house and garden filled with cats, chickens and ducks. They are all very domesticated and just gorgeous to cuddle. If you don&#39;t love animals, choose somewhere else to stay as Julias pets are part of the family. We Love Animals!!!

1047073,"The place is wonderful, our deluxe room had a really beautiful view of the ocean and it was next level of what we have experienced previously in Zanzibar. Traditional rooms, but with nice facilities. We appreciated the small details, toiletries, coffee machine with everything needed and the most important for Zanzibar, the water and the fridge.   Everyday there was someone coming with a bugspray for avoiding mosquitos, but I think in Africa is hard to avoid all the bugs in the room. The restaurant was very nice and the drinks&amp;food great, the only downside was that sometimes was cooked in a way, other time in another way, but delicious. There’s private beach with few sunbeds and chairs and our dog friend Kongo, who enjoys swimming in the ocean waves. Local people were often meeting for the fish market on the beach in front of the restaurant and you could take part of an interesting custom of theirs.  If we return to Zanzibar, we would totally come back to Hebe Bungalows. The drainage system in the bathroom was clogged and bugs were sometimes coming in from the pipes after the water was slowly draining (it’s understandable for Africa, but worth taking a look into this). Also we didn’t get the breakfast to go in our last day as the owner arranged because the chef forgot about it, not uncommon for staff around Zanzibar to forget to take care of the customers.  Just a thing that might make the place perfect would be a pool - maybe in the future - as sometimes the ocean is going far on low tide and it would be wonderful to have a place to relax in the meantime.",pet,0,llm_validated,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

33575,"This hotel is one that allows pets. We were not sure what we would find when we checked in. When you are traveling on a budget with a pet sometimes the accommodations can be way overpriced and very disappointing. Some places charge a ridiculous rate for pets and are not really that pet friendly. The pet fee at this hotel was only 25. Though the hotel was older (and a bit worn) it was clean and the staff extremely friendly and kind to our little Bella. She had a fine time going out for her walks, the area was safe to walk her (even at night) and away from traffic and she was always greeted with a Hello Bella from the staff when she returned. It was disappointing that the new ice maker had not yet been delivered (installation was over due - not the hotels fault certainly) and the staff apologized for the lack of an ice maker. Luckily the weather was not extremely hot. A small refrigerator in the room would have been nice. Belgin waffle at breakfast was quite good, much better than expected for a do-it-yourself waffle.

Last month, we (my dog, Dana and I) went to Ft Lauderdale, and we stayed at the Ocean breeze motel. We had a wonderful stay. The motel doesn't allow regular p...view moreets, which is one of the reasons we chose it. Less to possibly distract Dana. Beyond that, the rates were low enough for a lower income (the drunk was uninsured) disabled man and his K9 assistant. The owners treated us wonderfully, as they treat their property. What a great place to spend a week in paradise. After the grueling Chicago winter we have suffered (08-09), this motel felt like our home away from home, and we would definitely choose them if we ever would go to Ft Lauderdale again.

Rick P was very condescending and not at all welcoming. He basically called me a liar and asked inappropriate questions regarding my service dog. He was overall an arrogant person. I felt like I was a prisoner in this hotel for fear of being ridiculed by staff. Staff for the most part just wanted to get the job done and didn't have time for cordial interactions. Room was okay, nothing special about this hotel -- Overpriced for what it is. The first interaction I had was with Rick, so nothing that the hotel could offer could make that better. They should train their staff on how to act with people with disabilities. Since then, I've been to other hotels that have treated me and my dog 10 times better than this place. Won't stay at any of their branches again out of principle.I certainly appreciate you writing a survey regarding your stay with us. I was made aware of this situation and have since reviewed ADA policy in regards to service animals, with all my front desk staff. I'm sorry you felt uncomfortable while staying with us, that is certainly not our objective. We are a hotel that does not allow pets, but service animals are not considered Pets by the ADA. We like any other business, are required by law to allow all animals being identified as service animals entry into the building.

With your stay, you get a free breakfast, an early evening snack which is pretty much a meal, three free drinks per person per night, a rooftop swimming pool and jacuzzi and close proximity to much in New Orleans. Staff is friendly and helpful. Nightly rates will vary according to season, holidays and days of the week, but we were greatly satisfied with what we paid. Look for deals online.

There are times when we have activities in the city that bring young adult groups to the hotel and it sounds like this may have been the case during your visit.

2770,"The hotel is well located for Central SF, we walked to Union Square and if you can take the hills Fisherman's Wharf isn't too far, and of course Hyde Street is on the Cable Car network, although not the section right outside the hotel. It is an old historic building with a lot of character but we did find our room to be very cramped particularly compared to everything else we stayed in on our trip. Front desk staff were helpful and friendly and breakfast was fine. The stair carpets were pretty dirty but as decorating works were underway I guess they're due for cleaning or changing once this has finished.The only other moan I have about this hotel is the pet policy ( it allows them). This is a compact inner city hotel with no outside space and seems unsuitable for pets ( dogs usually). When we were there a guest brought their dog into the breakfast room and later the same dog dumped a pile of you know what on the stairs. Yes this is down to an irresponsible owner but does show that a review of this policy may be needed.Would I go back again, you bet, even with the negatives it's good value and SF is a great city but next time I'll remember my hat, scarf, coat and gloves!",pet,1,llm_validated,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

We paid 35 for overnight parking. Once you get parked just walk everywhere, I love walking around Seattle.The only complaint I had was the pet fee changing from the time I booked it until the time we actually stayed. The fee had gone up 50. I didn't complain or say anything because I just didn't feel like having a dispute about it. I also wish they'd had an area for the dogs to do their business, luckily I always carry poop bags, but my Dog had to go very suddenly on the street because I couldn't find a green space close enough, so I just picked it up of course.I guess with big cities it's harder to have an outdoor area for pets.Now to all the great things, which was pretty much everything.The lobby was beautiful, nice lighting, everything was clean, there were large hallways and huge ceilings.Our check in was quick, easy and friendly.We were given a room on the 29th floor with a great view of the city.The room had huge windows, it was a really clean room, spacious and beautiful.The bed was really comfy and also very clean.The Bathroom was massive and I really mean that, it has a gorgeous soaking tub, walk in shower, toilet and vanity area. You have lots of amenities with this hotel.There is a nice hallway space and an awesome do not disturb button that turns a light on and you don't have to hang something on your door, loved that.We had food and drink options that were attached to the hotel in the front, which is always nice for a quick and easy option.We ordered room service with our TV remote. The breakfast that came was delicious, very prompt and with friendly service.We slept amazingly with the fantastic bed and black out shades.When we came back into our hotel on the Saturday afternoon/evening before the show we got on the elevator with a Seattle Mariner, that was pretty cool.Everything about our experience here was perfect from the moment we arrived to the moment we sadly left.This was a bit of a splurge but I hope that one day we can stay here again.I also wanted to add that every staff member I encountered was always friendly to myself, my DH and our Dog.Thanks for a great weekend in Seattle for the show.",pet,1,agreed,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

The lobby is great with a very nice and plentiful breakfast, as well as snacks midday and coffee or lemon infused water all day! Our room was super clean and could not have been nicer, plus having two separate vanities/sinks really spoiled us. There was even a window in the bathroom for FRESH air. We found the French Quarters to be dirty and intimidating at times (so many homeless), so being in this area was another plus...surrounded by beautiful homes, trolley across the street, a few blocks from the Fresh Market grocery and the best bonus of all was the grassy park right next door which came in handy for those late night/early morning potty breaks for our dog. I am so glad that we were unable to find a pet friendly hotel WITH GRASS in the Quarters as we would have been so unhappy and absolutely loved our stay here, and this location for half the price also!! One more thing is parking...it was free and gated They gave us a remote control so we could come and go as we pleased knowing we would always have a free parking space waiting for us at the end of the day.

5155,"A luxury hotel can often curtail you from experiencing the local culture I've certainly experienced this at many hotels. This Ritz Carlton however, provides luxury and immerses you with the local culture. Like what many neighbors of the Ritz Carlton experience, I felt like I was returning to a luxury residence building. You enter effortlessly past bellman that remember you, and into what feels more like a private foyer rather than a lobby. From there you can be up to your room in no-time given elevators that you rarely have to wait on and our rooms proximity to the elevator - which is what I loved given my 35pound dog traveled with me.The Parkview Guestroom we had on the 6th floor was beautifully decorated and had unforgettable views into the park. Since it was winter, we were able to look right into the park - specifically viewing a sanctuary and large pond. The room was also very well laid out, and even with a rollaway bed it felt spacious.A spa treatment at the onsite LaPrairie Spa was very private and relaxing. Auden Bistro the Star Lounge feature classic menus with discrete service. Espressos ordered through Room Service arrived quickly and hot. And the complimentary coffee and tea in the bar was appreciated.The Ritz Carlton certainly extends their service and amenities to pets as well. My dog was treated like a prince! He was given several welcome amenities and genuinely recognized by the staff each time he passed through the lobby.The purpose of this stay was to celebrate my mom's birthday with my parents. They recognized the celebration and provided a unique amenity for my mom - a large silver frame with the Ritz Carlton logo! I even really enjoyed the location, with a great espresso bar around the corner, a very casual Italian restaurant recommended by the concierge, and of course the park.Some staff outshines others, there is a faint sound of street noise from the 6th floor, and there's the smell of horses when in front of the property - but none of this takes away from the hotel's well deserving status of being a Forbes 5 Star AAA 5 Diamond property.

Three nights again in a beautiful and spacious Metropolitan Suite with proper blackout shades installed in 2016 per my request. Air con was great as always. Had our dog with us again, too.Service and food/beverage again were fabulous. Spectacular Platinum recognition, as always, due both to my Ambassador level status and the fact that I stay here many times every year. (I'll be back again in late August.)The only misses were:(1) Concierge had sloppy mistakes confusing our party sizes for bookings at 2* Commis and 3* Saison. Created a bit of confusion and a little exasperation when arriving at Saison and booking was under wrong name. Settled but stupid.(2) Twice had calls to butler ring way too long before anyone picked up. Pet peeve of mine.(3) Room service didnt have pork sandwich as per menu for a lunch order, then brought my chicken sandwich ordered without avocado...but with avocado--and not toasted fully. Stupid and not impressive. Replaced quickly and whole lunch order was compd.Obviously, the service recovery was wonderful in each instance.

Due to a mix up, no transport was set up for me to get from the airport (Reagan DCA) to the hotel (Yotel DC) and back again, after the stay. I’m traveling Oct 19, 2021 thru Oct 21, 2021. If anyone has any experience with this and /or could possibly suggest a company I could call to get this set up, it would be very much appreciated. I’ve never used a wheelchair before (well, not all the time anyway) and am still getting used to it.I plan on using an overnight bag, as a carry on and will hold it in my lap.

670,"Hello and good afternoon! My name is Karen and I am a 59 year old plus sized woman (currently 305 lbs coming down from originally being 430 lbs). I currently own a Pride Victory 10 mobility scooter because at the time I got it (5 years ago) that was the only mobility scooter Medicare would cover (at 80%) for a person weighing over 430 pounds. I would be very grateful on any advice/opinions any of you have on folding wheelchairs. Being as I have had my mobility scooter for quite a few years now, it is time to get something new again. Do I get another scooter, do I get a power wheelchair, or do I get one of those plus a folding wheelchair??? All decisions I need to make and would sure appreciate your input. I do not own and cannot afford to buy a vehicle with a lift (on SSDI with very limited income), so I got ADA certified and ride a paratransit bus that has a lift here in Phoenix, Az to my doctors appointments, pharmacy, etc….The problem is I have no social life, or way to go out to do anything fun like out to dinner with friends, going to a mall, craft fairs, visit friends houses etc because paratransit will not take me to anywhere other than medically related places. I did not know about folding wheelchairs until just recently. It folds up, I can put it in the trunk of a friends vehicle, put it in the trunk of a Uber…..I could actually go places and do things again!! Plus just on a side note in case this helps someone else decide on a scooter…my Pride Victory 10 has been wonderful, very relaible, never a problem. However it is big, wide, heavy even broken down into pieces, and longer than most other scooters because it is a bariatric sized scooter as well. It for sure causes issues at times because of the turning radius, space in restaurants, it’s longer than most street vans with ramps up the back can usually fit. Allll of that being said (whew!!) what do you all think of FOLDING wheelchairs? It would still have to be for a plus sized me, so I would need a weight capacity over 305 lbs. Are they comfortable, relaible, can I even lift one by myself or would I need constant help to be able to use it by myself? Brand names you recommend and why?? Sorry for the book, I just wanted to tell you as much as I could so you could know what I would need better maybe??? Any information or suggestions would be very much appreciated.

1715,"The New Premier Caribbean Hotel for Wheelchair Accessible Travelers has now opened in St. Maarten The Morgan Resort & Spa - St Maarten Luxury ResortMy husband and I were lucky enough to get to be the very first wheelchair guests at the new Morgan Hotel this past May and we were in love at first sight. From the moment you arrive at the property you know you have arrived somewhere very special as you pass through two sets of gates and guard houses before reaching the glamorous front of the hotel; where the amazingly friendly valet/door-people will help you out of your vehicle. Whether it’s helping to assemble back your manual wheelchair or safely unloading a power wheelchair, the staff was obviously trained well as to how to best assist us wheeled travelers. (They will even help carry every last piece of equipment you may have traveled with; and we brought a lot)As you enter the glamorous but modestly sized lobby, you can’t help but take your eyes off of the giant, gorgeous infinity pool overlooking the ocean that’s just on the other side of the lobby(*Will come back to the pool in a sec). The amazing front desk staff and concierge will not only help you get checked in, but will personally escort you to your room to help orient you with the hotel amenities and make sure you have everything you need while settling in (ask for Arielle; she’s phenomenal). After taking some time to explore the giant accessible room and attached living room, I noticed how they remembered all the little details that are most important to us accessible travelers: lowered closets, electrical controls all within reach, access to the entire room; accessible bathroom with roll under sink, safety toilet (with good amount of grab bars), roll-in shower (flip down benches on order to replace shower chairs); handheld+waterfall shower heads; as well as having the coffee machine, safe and fridge within reachable zone.Honestly I was blown away by how much they got right with the room; especially after staying at some insane nightmare hotels in the caribbean that claimed to be accessible prior to booking the room. Whoever designed this hotel really took the time to plan out what was needed for their 9 (yes I said 9) accessible rooms and oceanfront suites. What impressed me even more, was the General Manager (Saul) took the time to sit down with us to get some feedback about how we were finding the accessible features of the hotel; and took the time to walk around the property and room with us and his builder to see what else could be improved on as they were finishing up the property. (Which was not much at all. Just some little stuff like a lower peep hole for the door, changing the bathroom door handle to add a few inches of entry area and changing from shower seats to benches for safety).Just like many hotels where we try to give some critical feedback on the accessibility of the property, they could have just humored us and pretended to care; but no, not these folks. They truly seem to be concerned about making the changes ASAP so that ALL guests get the chance to enjoy their property equally. That’s not something you find often in any hotel; let alone a hotel in the Carribean. They even are ordering some beach wheelchairs to use for the pool and maybe even the neighboring beaches. (They can even rent you a beach wheelchair from a local company to be able to take to the other beaches on the island who will bring the chair right to you at that beach and come back at the end of the day for it).Now speaking of their fabulous pool. Never in my life have I seen such a large pool with zero-degree entry going around the entire sides of this football field sized pool. (There is a regular entry point of the pool too if that’s easier). You’ll never want to get out of this pool and you probably won’t need to since the fantastic pool staff bring you anything you need and the bar in the water will fulfill all your cocktail and food fantasies. What I loved was the fact they had these soft pool chairs surrounding the pool (1’ away) that I could easily pull myself out of the water and right into the chair from. The only negative I will say about any of this is the fact that they put the hot tub in the middle of the pool with no other entry point and you have to go up stairs and down stairs to switch bodies of water. There also is a really cool swim in a cave in the corner with a built in waterslide; but no way to get to the top of the slide if your legs don’t work (not that my spine Dr. would appreciate me trying slides…lol).If you can drag yourself away from the pool, you must try the restaurant and bar. Chef David will BLOW YOUR MIND with his food. He hit it out of the park on his first try with the opening menu for the hotel. My spouse couldn’t stop raving about the Lobster and the Seafood Paella and I was obsessed with the vegetarian items on the menu; especially the Empanadas (They even serve an Impossible burger; which is so hard to find in St. Maarten). Every single thing we tried for breakfast was delicious and will fill you up well for your busy day on the island. Try the fruit and bread platter if you can or the pancakes will have you licking the plate. Or if you don;t feel like dining, try out the bar and let the Bartender Nigel make you one of his enticing cocktails (let alone he’s the nicest guy to talk to on the island).I wish I could list every single person who went out of their way to take care of our every need at the hotel; but it would add an entire page to this review. Let’s just say I can’t say one negative thing about any of the employees at the hotel. They all made us feel so welcome and treated us as if we were visiting their own home. Leaving was the most difficult part of our entire visit at the hotel. We spent two life changing weeks at the Morgan and tried out every aspect of that resort and they passed every test we threw at them. There are very few hotels I have ever fallen in love with, but this one definitely moved into my heart for life and I can’t wait to return. (Or move to the island… that is how much they made us fall in love with St. Maarten here) Please trust me, you won’t be disappointed and you’ve never enjoyed yourself more on vacation till you stay here. (You don’t even have to have a wheelchair to have as good of a time as us).",handicap,1,agreed,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
1444,Anyone here who flies frequently notice an increase in the number of passengers who are taking advantage the pre-board option? Especially on Southwest?I use wheelchair full time and always need to preboarder and use a aisle chair. If I am flying Southwest I can transfer directly from my chair to a seat in the front rows but only if they are not already occupied. The gate agents are always really good about getting me on first but there is always a line of at least ten other “disabled” people jockeying for position behind me and giving me dirty looks because I get to board first. What’s amazing is that the majority of them are all ambulatory and walk down the jetway without any assistance at all and when we get to our destination pop right up and sprint out the plane.Am I wrong in being totally annoyed with this or is it just my imagination that this seems to be happening more and more. I also fly other airlines that have assigned seats and I never see the number of pre-boarders that I do when I fly Southwest. I understand that there are a lot of peoples who need assistance to get through the terminals to the gates because of the distances involved but to then get preferential seating for no real reason seems wrong to me.,handicap,1,agreed,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

18,"My husband watched the 1956 Moby Dick with Gregory Peck and said “Let’s have a Moby Dick weekend in New Bedford” and we did. He is a full-time wheelchair user, only able to use his right side. We have recently “graduated” from Hoyer lift to slide board transfers wheelchair ←> bed, and that makes finding a hotel easier. It was a wonderful trip with no “surprises”. Hotel: Fairfield Inn at Marriott. ADA room with 2 queens. I called the hotel directly 2 days before arrival and Jaz at the front desk was very helpful. She measured top of bed height (24”) which made for a pretty level transfer. I explained that getting out of bed would require backing the wheelchair up to the headboard, so any nightstand must be movable. The left-hand bed did not have a nightstand on the left so that worked. I also asked for bathroom grab bars to be on the right, and she double checked that our room had that config. When we arrived, everything was as specified. My husband and I did not need assistance, but I saw our check-in person Mallory helping a couple with mobility issues load their bags on a dolly. Free breakfast was a better than average self-serve. I served my husband, but there was staff refilling food and I bet they would help someone if asked. Activities: Harbor-walk: beautiful, wide 1.5 mile walkway along the water. Made of large concrete sidewalk slabs and the transitions, while pretty good, were still painful for my husband. Whaling museum: A great museum. You could spend a whole day there. Roomy elevators to all floors, even the observation deck. The only thing inaccessible is climbing into the whaling ship model. I took the highlights tour (even though my husband chose not to) and it was also accessible. Fort Tabor: Lots of paved paths around the fort and by the water. Totally smooth sailing. Walking: Historic center roads are cobblestones, uncomfortable even in a car. Sidewalks are slate, which wasn’t too bad, and crosswalks are slate. I managed to find street or lot parking everywhere. I took a guided whaling themed walking tour for an hour while my husband sat on the whaling museum patio, but the walk covered just one city block and we did not enter buildings, so it would have been possible in a wheelchair. Restaurants:All were accessible and people went out of their way to be helpful. Antonio’s: They put out a ramp so the wheelchair could climb the one step to get in. There was room to navigate to a table. Tia Maria’s: We ate outdoors at a table. We loved the food and went twice. Lots of authentic Portuguese faire. Indoors would not be accessible. Black Whale: Large parking lot, easy ramp, lots of roomy table choices. Coastal Bubbles Wine Bar: On my walk I saw a lovely deck with the sign “Sip, slurp, Sundays. Oysters $2”. The deck was up a flight of stairs, but the manager showed me that entering at the back of the restaurant was street level. Best oysters of the summer. Lovely fall weather and a great trip.

15,"I’m just back from a three week, six country vacation in Europe. As a person with a spinal cord injury who cannot stand/walk, the past 35 years of air travel has been extremely frustrating and sometimes physically painful. I always come home saying I never want to stop traveling, but I wish, just once, the air travel would go smoothly. Well this time was oh so close! Nearly as perfect as it could get. I fly United out of O’Hare a number of times per year. In comparing O’Hare against most of the European airports I’ve been through, it has always provided the least attention to me as a wheelchair user. This time, something was different. More special treatment, a specific line at customs, and better trained personnel from the agents to the lift assistants. What, Finally?? It would have been an absolutely mind blowing experience had my chair been at the plane door when I arrived back in Chicago. The agent said I’d have to go to baggage claim to get it. Knowing my rights, I said my chair must be delivered to the door. (Ok, technically “as close to the door as possible”). Funny, within literally seconds, my chair appeared. What? OK. That was it. The attendant wheeled me through the wheelchair line at customs and we were out the door. Just wanted to share. Hope this is the start of a trend. 🤞 For the trip we flew into Amsterdam and out of Zurich. I splurged and hired a driver for the Netherlands and Belgium where we attended the Fomula 1 Dutch Grand Prix practice day and visited a few WWI & II memorial sites. I set up the hotels and sites on my own for this part of the trip. Then we made our way to France where we met some friends and hired the Claire & George Foundation (C&G)based in Bern Switzerland to drive us through Luxembourg, Germany, and Switzerland. C&G provided a driver, set up all accessible hotels, and any attraction and event tickets for us They even arranged a hoyer lift for me to be delivered to our hotels It was a wonderful, stress-free trip that included the Mosel Wine festival and a Champaign region tour I highly recommend C&G. They are easy to work with and can help plan the type of travel you like. Last year they set up a mostly train tour of Switzerland for us. After all the years of setting up my own travel, it was nice to have someone else do the work. Now, if they could only take care of those cobblestones… Happy to share locations and hotels.

938,"Hi, I'm Pam, a proud Disney Adult! I completed an internship at Walt Disney World through Disney University, worked there for a few years, and am now a religious vlog watcher and travel agent! You would think that I would've known all that there is to know about Walt Disney World with that resume, but it wasn't until I traveled with family and friends with disabilities that I learned first-hand about accessible travel. To me, being a true ally to the disabled community is learning from their lived experiences, so I am grateful that I now have this knowledge to pass on along with all of my other tips and tricks! Walt Disney World is beloved for many reasons, and one of those is its vast options of accessible activities. I recommend reading the descriptions of the rides online ahead of time to see which ones not only seem accessible for you, but are experiences that you would enjoy! Some rides you can stay in a power wheelchair, while others require a transfer. Some rides have specific seats for those needing to transfer. One example is the brand new Tron ride at Magic Kingdom. The standard seat looks similar to a motorcycle, but there is a ""caboose"" in the back that is an accessible seat. If you are capable of transferring, one thing that I learned is that when the cast members (workers) ask ""can you transfer?"" first ask ""what are my options?"" One example for this is the Jungle Cruise ride in Magic Kingdom. My friend said that she could transfer and she did. The steepness of the stairs getting into and out of the ride were more steep than she thought. My daughter and I ended up helping her quite a bit, which we were happy to do, but we found out after that there was an accessible boat where she could have stayed in a wheelchair! Another great option is the Disability Access Pass (DAS) which is intended for guests who have difficulty tolerating extended waits in a conventional queue environment due to a disability. This pass allows guests to request a return time for a specific experience that is comparable to the current standby wait. This feature permits guests using the DAS to enjoy other experiences in the park instead of physically waiting in the standby line. Guests can register in person or pre-register via live video call (the guest with a disability must be present) and use DAS Advance pre-arrival planning. It is most convenient to use the DAS on the My Disney Experience app which is available for smart phones. This app has so many great features. Besides the DAS, two that are very helpful are the listed updated wait times and the ability to pre-order quick service food. Speaking of planning ahead, while there are wheelchairs and mobility scooters available to rent (for a fee) at the parks, it is much more economical and efficient to rent through an outside company. When mobility aids are rented through the park, they have to stay in the park. Renting through an outside company allows you to take the wheelchair or scooter anywhere. Some of the resorts at Walt Disney World are huge, so the walk from the hotel to the bus could be very exhausting. A company called Scooterbug is the exclusive provider of mobility devices for Walt Disney World. This distinction is important because they can drop off the scooter at your resort without you being present. With the possibility of flight delays or other mishaps, this service offers great peace of mind. One thing that we learned when asking the front desk for my friend's scooter: if you book through an agent, the device could possibly be under their name. Mobility devices and scooters aren't the only pieces of equipment available for rent (from other companies - Scooterbug only offers wheelchairs, scooters, and strollers). One example for this is that my friend rented an IV pole for her feeding tube. While enjoying is priority number one, it is also a good idea to know the medical services available ahead of time just in case. AdventHealth is the official healthcare provider of Walt Disney World. They have medical equipment for rent, urgent care services, virtual appointments available 24/7, in-park first aid, and a new full-service emergency room minutes from Walt Disney World. While we never like to think about these things happening on vacation, knowing that these services are conveniently available and accessible provides peace of mind when travelling. Walt Disney World has accessible room options in all of their hotels. It is important to think about what you need ahead of time so that questions can be asked before booking the room. Some of these questions are the height of the bed and whether you need a powered door to get in and out of the room. Only you know what you need best! Working with a travel agent who has experience in accessible travel can also help you to brainstorm some questions specific to your needs. I could talk about Walt Disney World all day long!

417,"I recently flew from Eugene Oregon to Seattle Washington on an Embraer ERJ 175 Alaska Airline in which I made reservations months in advance. Three days before I traveled I received a call confirming my power wheelchair and that it was to be gate checked and put in the only slot on the airline for power wheelchairs. Upon arrival at the airport, after checking in for my flight, I was told that my power wheelchair, which is 36 inches in total height, was too tall to fit on the aircraft. I have a tilt function, which I tilted back so that the hand grips were no higher than 33 inches, and was told that this was sufficient to fit on the aircraft. After we boarded and the plane was ready to take off, the cargo personnel came on the airplane to tell me that my power wheelchair would not fit on the airplane. I was told I had two options, one was to continue on with this flight and my power wheelchair would arrive with any luck later that evening as my destination was Washington DC and my second choice was I could be taken off the airplane yet there were no other flights out that day and they could not confirm there was even one the next day that could get us to Washington DC. I continue on with our travels and made it to Washington DC on the flights that we had reserved months in advance, and my power wheelchair arrived the next day at 11 AM. On return flight we have the similar plane from Seattle to Eugene and experienced the same problem, only this time my power wheelchair did not arrive at my home until a day and a half later. The bottom line is make sure that you do not fly with a power wheelchair that has a total height no greater than 33 inches on an Embraer ERJ 175 aircraft. Alaska airline I’m sure it’s not the only airline that utilizes this style of airplane.

420,"I would prefer to write a complete review of this hotel after my stay, but my experience with Hyatt while trying to make reservations has been nothing less than miserable. My husband and I are planning to attend a conference in July 2024 that will be held at the Hyatt Buffalo. After registering for the conference, I followed the instructions on the conference website and attempted to make reservations for two rooms at the special conference rate. I reserved both an accessible room with a roll-in shower for my husband and myself (an amputee and wheelchair user) and a standard room for my aide. While I had no problem making a reservation for my aide at the conference rate, I was told by the Hyatt reservation agent that I would be charged nearly double for the accessible room because there were no accessible rooms within the conference room block. I contacted one of the conference planners to request assistance in getting both rooms at the conference rate. During the contract process, he explained, the conference planners were told by Hyatt sales staff it was impossible to contract for accessible rooms as they needed to be made available to all Hyatt customers. While this is a nice thought, it is just not true. This conference, and others like it are held annually. It is the custom of the meeting planners to make sure that there are accessible rooms available within the room block as there is a large percentage of individuals with disabilities who attend the conference, and they require accessible rooms. Attendees of this conference in previous years are surveyed about their need for accessible rooms so the planners can ensure that an appropriate number of rooms are available in subsequent years. I contacted Hyatt Global Customer Care Center. I was told I could not have an accessible room at the conference rate as the room block was sold out. So why could I confirm a standard room for my aide at the conference rate? The practice of charging one rate for a standard room and a higher rate for an accessible room is blatant discrimination, and a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act and, I imagine, any number of state and federal laws designed to enhance interstate commerce and to prevent similar acts of prejudice.

I booked 3 staterooms including a suite for my son’s family and a cabin for my medical aide. We decided to let NCL provide air arrangements, transfer and overnight stay at the Anchorage Hilton for myself, my wife and my aide. The handicapped rooms with roll in shower do not have hand showers! The travel department put my aide on a separate flight from mine for the return journey. I called to change this and was told “because she did not have the same booking number as my itinerary there was nothing that they could do until 10 days before the travel date” even though I said it was not possible for me to travel without my aide!

I then contacted Alaska Air handicapped assistance to have my seat move nearer the front of the plane since I require an aisle chair.

1069,"My name is Danielle and I am a disabled content creator. My channels are called “Daniellevates” because the content is all about elevating ideas about disability and rare disease. Full-length vlogs feature accessibility reviews from my adventures in Boston and beyond.Short form content consists of series such as Breaking the 4th Wall of Disability, Accessible Design in the Wild, and more! Since birth, I have had an extremely rare technically undiagnosed neuromuscular disease. You can watch & subscribe to me here . This vlog is part two of a day trip from Boston to New York City, and the purpose of the trip was to see ""Into the Woods"" on Broadway! This vlog takes us from the outside of the St. James Theatre and to our seats. I now have my own mobility scooter, but during this trip I used a transport chair that I borrowed from my local senior center. While there are many aspects to having a disability that make life more difficult, we have to utilize the advantages when they come our way! Case in point: you can see our group receive the VIP treatment and skip the line to get into the theater safely. I was very pleasantly surprised by the proactive nature of the St. James Theatre. I selected an ADA seat for myself and an ADA companion seat for my friend, and they emailed me the night before to see if I would like to transfer into one of their seats or stay in my chair. When I indicated that I would be transferring, they said that they would store my chair and bring it back at intermission or anytime that I needed it. I would say that this email is not usual, so definitely plan ahead and ask any questions that you have ahead of time. For someone like myself, sitting in an ADA seat is a must. While I can do stairs with railings, they are draining and I am dependent on them having railings and not being too steep. Additionally, in an emergency, I would likely be one of the last ones out of the building anyways, so adding stairs as an obstacle is not a good idea. The show was amazing, and the rest of the video shows us dining in Times Square, our Amtrak train ride home (spoiler alert: half of us missed the train!), a recap of the trip and an awkward bathroom mishap, and a celebrity cameo from two comedy legends! Broadway lived up to the hype, and our little day trip was definitely chock-full of New York Moments. Key Takeaways If you need ADA seating for your health and safety, don't overthink it. Utilize these seats! Think of possible situations ahead of time (seating, bathroom, entering and exiting) and contact the theater with any questions. I should not have waited for them to contact me - this is a rare phenomenon in my experience! If a situation comes up that you didn't think of (like me wanting to get to my seat safely from the dense crowd), don't be afraid to ask for assistance. New York City is crowded. The streets aren't in good condition (I highlight this in part 1 of the NYC Vlogs). Plan ahead for what mobility aid you might need in these conditions. Make a list weeks before the show of what equipment and supplies that you will need. Add to this list whenever you think of something and pack your bag at least one day before.

I have MS and can't walk without help, BA did nothing, their partners Iberia did nothing. At about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches. I lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music course. BA insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. I would not have got on the plane had I known. I found out I could go to arbitration. BA now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if I do. Their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is bad enough. For someone who is not mobile, it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of Duty of Care and towards Disabled Passengers.

227,"My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that âthere are no facilities here at the airport to rebook youâ. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to âgo online to rebook your seatâ. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport âmust be wrongâ. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a Â£30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight.

As someone travelling with us is registered blind we could reserve seats before others on both flights with ease, priority boarding was given as well. Online check in was smooth and boarding passes on the outbound were printed off. On our flight out to Athens we were given a choice of a hot or cold meal. As I had something to eat before; I passed, but this was great given that some people would have been transiting quickly and wouldn't have time to eat at the terminal. The night flight on the way back was also good as meals (one hot option only) were offered with free drinks and pillows were available. Flight attendants were professional on both flights. Both flights landed early (one 35mins early!). If there is anything I could ask BA to improve on is allowing one desk open at Athens for all flights of the day for anyone that arrives early and just wants to print off boarding passes or offer self service kiosks at other airports outside of London.

Our departure dates: June 19, 2023 - Flight BA 294, Chicago to London. June 20 rebooked by BA on BA 546, London to Rome. All flights were late. On arrival in Rome, my wife was forced to walk to the check-in desk because our reservation for wheelchair assist from the plane was never transferred by BA. She was told by the cabin crew that there was no reservation for her transport. Also, our checked baggage (2) failed to make the BA rebooked flight from London to Rome. BA took 9 days to deliver my bag and 12 days to deliver my wife's. I called BA Baggage Claim Services daily. I was frequently cut off after waiting on hold for over an hour. We had Apple Air tags in both bags, and sent pictures showing their exact location to BA Baggage Claim several times. After 5 days, BA stated that they found my wife's bag, but needed to verify ownership! Both bags as described had bright pink 4â easily visible tags and bright pink bows. Taking 9 and 12 days to deliver them is inexcusable. Our return date: July 3 - BA 553, Rome to London. BA 297, London to Chicago. All flights were late. We arrived in Chicago more than 3 hours late, missing our ground transportation to our home in Michigan (3 hours away). We had to find a hotel and stay overnight near Chicago.

Servers in the lounge unhelpful and reluctant to produce champagne when requested. Boarding process was the BA chaos I have come to expect. Why do BA gate staff show so much resentment towards premium passagers. New club seating is atrocious. No better than economy with centre seat empty. No drink offered on boarding. Economy passagers access past club section via a very narrow aisle most carrying or dragging oversized cabin baggage. Late take off due to mix up over economy seat allocations, and late arrival of passengers needing wheelchair assistance. Seat very uncomfortable.

I got a bottle of water, and then nobody came to the pod I was in for the next 8 hours. One would have expected more from first class, maybe another bottle of water? They asked me to fill out what I would like for breakfast on a card. I filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came. The vacation itself was great. On the day of the return flight, our Trenitalia train broke down in Naples, and we were 80 mins late. My wife tried dozens of times to phone British Airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working; most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service. We tried the numbers from our tickets, their website, their help desk, Facebook page, Google etc. We tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins, and could not get through. My wife managed to check herself in online, but could not check me in. There was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in, once my wife pressed my name, the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete. It was a computer glitch we couldn't get around.  Ultimately we arrived at the Rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in. My wife was ok and could go through but I could not. We asked the 3 ladies at the British Airways desk for help, and they shrugged and said they couldn't help us. Apparently, they said it would have been different if we called before, and we showed them her phone (see the attached photos) with all the calls we made. They then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldn't reschedule us. They gave us another number to call My wife at this point was near tears. I am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior, so I was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs. She was managing all the luggage, the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressed. The attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way. The new secret customer service phone number we were given did work, and my wife was on the phone with Customer Service for over an hour. After reviewing the details with several teams of specialists, we were told basically that they didn't believe us that we tried to call, they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call. Nothing could be done for us, and they could only rebook us for $8800. No apologies whatsoever were given, nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in Rome.

3297,Flew MCT to LHR on 1 Nov 14. Staff at Muscat were excellent and could not have been more helpful to my wife (who is a wheelchair user). Catering on the flight was awful. Food was inedible and we were only served two drinks over an 11hr flight. On arrival the staff seemed to not know that she was a wheelchair user (despite having assistance booked in advance) which meant a stressful wait on the plane while here wheelchair was found and a lift ordered. We flew out on Oman air that was faster cheaper more comfortable had decent food and better informed staff.,handicap,1,agreed,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
2217,"I think that British Airways customer service must hold the accolade as the worst going, but that is their only achievement. Having booked our flight from Alicante to Gatwick I immediately selected and paid for seats in row 4 at a cost of â¬23 each. When I came to check in online, 24 hours before the flight, I found that we had been moved to row 30, the very back of the plane. When I selected 'Change your Seat' row 4 was not even displayed. I am 64 years old with back problems that make it quite difficult to struggle to the back of the plane. For this reason I am always more than happy to pay for seats near to the front and have never experienced any problem with other airlines I did not and have not received any notification from BA to tell me they had changed the seating. Nor have I received my money back. While waiting to board the plane I received a text message survey on my BA experience so far. I participated and gave a summary of the situation. I also agreed that they could contact me but still nobody did. When I got home I gave BA one day to contact me but when they did not I submitted a complaint through their website. After some days I got a reply saying: 'Would you like to claim a refund for your prepaid seating charge? Weâll be more than happy to see if youâre eligible if you complete the following form within 14 days of your flight'. I cannot think of another time where a supplier has taken my money, failed to deliver, and not informed me and automatically refunded my money. But with BA you have to 'claim' a refund and then wait while they 'check your eligibility'. My family take many flights each year including long hauls to Asia.

Security marred by a family carrying unrevealed bottles and liquids that was a field day for the security staff and simply a pain for the rest of us queuing behind them. The Cyprus airways lounge whilst much better than its predecessor is still third rate with a poor selection of food and wine and on this occasion overcrowded. Wandered to the gate in good time for boarding to be confronted by a flotilla of wheelchair-bound passengers all of whom get ultra priority boarding. So boarding took longer despite the fact that whilst Business class was almost full economy wasn't. On-board service was ok. Hot towels no menus drinks and a 3 course meal salad main dessert or cheese but somehow the service was not as impressive as my outbound.

67,"I arrived at the airport about 2.5 hours before takeoff to have more than about time to get checked in, go through security, etc. All that went without any issues. Being that I was relatively early at the gate, I was one of the first passengers there. After some time boarding had opened. First the business class got called up, then families with children and disabled people. A couple minutes into the boarding they started to call up people, one by one, by name. Then there was an announcement: they wonât let anyone in anymore. Me and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let in. The reason, they said, was that the plane was short staffed (Later I discovered, speaking to a manager, that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked). After the announcement people were getting angry because they wouldnât be let in anymore. Nothing changed and everyone was sent away. I had a connecting flight later that day that I was going to miss because I was not let on the plane. First I tried to get my luggage back which I didnât receive immediately but got a hold of later on thanks to the airport personnel. Then, just like everyone who was going to fly with the same plane, I wanted to talk to someone from British Airways. Since they donât have a service center at Frankfurt Airport everyone went to the check-in counters where we received food vouchers but not a single person was either able to rebook my or anyoneâs flight nor get anyone refunded. All the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund. I waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until today. Trying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the phone or hung up in the middle of the conversation. After the four hours of waiting for the email me and some other people from the same flight went back to the check-in counter to get a confirmation from them that I will receive a refund. Being that there was a new shift the personell did not know what had happened. When they scanned my passport an looked at the flight they found out that the system was dying that it was my fault I could not attend the flight. It looked like I had missed it. For everyone standing there with me it was exactly the same. But the people at the counter said they could not do anything about it. Later on we were able to speak to the manager after many phone calls he said they were going to take care of it. We are supposed to get an email at some point in the future. I was not able to get a written confirmation that I will get refunded even after several times asking for it. I already flew a lot of times in my life but never ever has such a thing a happened to me. Not only that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but also the customer service being so horrible that they were not able to rebook or confirm a refund in any way. In the end the only option for me to get to my destination would have been to book a last minute flight for a lot of money which I would not know if I ever got it backed.",handicap,1,agreed,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

2622,"My wife and I recently flew to California, outbound on A380 into LAX, returning to LHR from SFO on Boeing 747-400. Both legs in WT+ (Premium Economy). The Boeing 747-400 is very tired aircraft who BA seemingly are not investing in at all. The plastic surrounding the blind was coming away, the footrest (attached to the seat in front) did not go all the way down resulting in an uncomfortable seating position and the rest of the aircraft and area was just very old, tired and tatty. Despite BA insisting that the seat pitch is the same as the A380, it felt far more cramped, and much more like normal WT (Economy). Not helped by the Multimedia box and seat legs of the seat in front in exactly the wrong place to stretch out. The TV screens are very small and an old square format with far more limited programming compared with the A380. On the meal service, they ran out of the beef choice half way around the cabin service leaving only a vegetarian option (the helpful cabin crew did eventually find one from business class as WT+ gets the business class entree) but only as they had one left over. I feel if you pay for a service (at near-as-makes-no-difference twice the price of WT) with the word ""Premium"" in the title you should expect a premium product. BA do not offer free pre-seating (unless you book this 24 hours before departure thus you cannot guarantee to be seated together if the flight is full or near full), priority check-in, priority boarding, the pre-take-off drink is orange juice or water on all inbound flights. Additionally, despite BA boarding by seat row numbers, this was ignored by most passengers and ground staff alike so by the time we were called to board, the WT+ cabin was already full with very limited room for our carry on luggage, so it lucky that we travel very light! As you can tell, overall I feel that this was a lot of money for very little in return. Based upon our experience, I would recommend the WT+ in the A380 but only when departing from the UK (you can pre-order your meal and they serve wine as a pre-take off). In addition, WT+ on the 380 is upstairs in a small, cosy cabin, light and airy with a very useful storage bin on the window seats. These may be small points on their own, but combine to take the shine off a very expensive upgrade.",handicap,0,llm_validated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
2119,"London Heathrow to Hong Kong. Very disappointed by the gate agents or whoever was making decisions about seat allocation for BA 31 service to HKG on September 10th. I was buying my ticket in April, so early. As BA Executive Club Gold member I had reserved already then my favorite seat on this aircraft type, 51D on upper deck at time of buying the ticket. In AMS, when checking in for that flight, this seat was still granted, 2.5 hours later at gate I was reallocated to 14G on main deck. First no explanation, then that they ""could make a family happy to sit together"", but they could not tell me if this family was traveling with children or not. No other seat available due to a full flight. Just the cabin service director was able to get me a change to 13B, a seat a little further away from the restrooms. But still recurring disturbing odors and noisier flight on main deck. - I have gotten already 2620 EC tier points this year and have little understanding for how they treated me. I am so regularly flying with them, they know my preferences: upper deck, aisle seat and as much in front as possible. I am ready to give up my seat for families with infants or any handicapped person, but upon their reaction I guess this was not the case.  Communication is marketing and this was very bad done by BA this time! Why should I be loyal to a company which is not respecting my loyalty benefits? Especially concerning their reservation policy, that people not paying for reservation earlier on or booking late need to be aware that they might not be seated together!

1562,"London to Hong Kong in premium economy. I have been flying BA on my many trips over the last six years, and I have seen such a shocking decline in their services that I feel compelled to write this review. Of my six flights this year, three were seriously delayed. One was from Oslo to London on 9th June, when the captain decided to wait  for some Business Class passengers who hadn't made their way out of the lounge in time for take-off. My worst experience, however, was going to Hong Kong on 30th May, when there was a technical fault with the plane. The captain decided to board passengers at the scheduled time, who then sat on the plane for almost three hours, without being offered any water or other refreshments, and with little information and apologies, before an 11-hour flight. I was in Premium Economy, but the extra amount I paid did not offer any additional comfort. I switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets, which meant that I got no rest during the night. How can Premium Economy seats be next to the toilet? The in-flight service was poor, as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the night. I am still wondering why anybody would pay for Premium Economy, as it is just a lousy offer: seats are only marginally more spacious than in Economy (but don't recline as they would in Economy), the food is the same, which means rather bad, and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight. Predictably, the plane landed in Hong Kong just in time (below three hours' delay) for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flight. I had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on 4th June, but then I found out that BA had scrapped the sparkling wine as a welcome drink for Premium Economy passengers. Although this time the flight was on time, this gave me such a bad feeling about BA, their cynical attitude towards their passengers and their meanness. I will look for alternative airlines from now on and would recommend to avoid flying with BA.",handicap,0,llm_validated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
2112,"London to Johannesburg return. Still waiting for a reply, after 6 attempts via email, post and phone to make contact. On flight BA 0055 to Johannesburg the inflight service was the worst we have ever experienced. We took off around 19h30, and were only offered a drink at 21h30. This was the only drink offered that night. Dinner was served at 22h30, no drinks accompanied this. We were surprised to see we were sitting in the back row of the plane, which was not what was shown on the diagram when we booked and paid extra for selecting our seats when we made the booking. We did not have a choice of meals as they had run out, all we were offered was a very poor excuse for a mushroom risotto, which was inedible. It took over an hour for the trays to be cleared away. Breakfast was served to the special diets around 04h30, waking the entire section where we were seated, then the lights turned off for another hour until we were offered an equally horrible breakfast. Coffee was not offered at all - the amount of liquids offered was below minimum requirements, if we had not taken our own water with us we would have had a problem. When we departed the plane it look like a rubbish tip, no waste had been collected during the flight, the cabin staff were surly and uninterested. Prior to this flight we tried to avoid the âback of planeâ issues by paying an additional Â£56.00 for exit row seats. The payment was accepted and receipt issued via email. When we went to check in online our original seats had been allocated again. When we arrived at Johannesburg airport we were told that the seats were no longer available and had been allocated to other passengers. No apology or explanation was given. Not the way we wanted our holiday to end. The service on this flight was as to be expected, regular drinks offered (water throughout the night), the only negatives being no choice for dinner and a poor breakfast. Cabin staff were very good. We have not received a refund for the Â£56.00 paid for the exit row seats, and I await an explanation as to why these seats were not allocated to us. Even though we were flying economy, we expect a level of service and edible food. If the back rows are to receive less or no choice on food and drinks then they should be charged less. This is unfair and bad business practice. Upon speaking to other people who have flown with BA, the general consensus seems to be that only first / business class passengers seem to be valued, and our experience confirms this. BA were not the cheapest flights by far, we opted to fly with them due to reputation, which was sorely let down.",handicap,0,llm_validated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

My other half who is 6'3"" was locked into a paralysed position for 13 hours made worse when the passenger in front reclined their seat for 90% of the flight. The small metal box in front of his seat also restricted his leg room and comfort. He couldn't even watch the in-flight entertainment as there was barely a gap between the screen and his face after the seat in front was reclined. As a shorter limbed person at 5'4"", I was also deeply uncomfortable through most of the flight. Placed in the middle, I barely had any where to put myself, seats were so narrow and confined and the person sitting on the other side of me was of slight build. My headphone socket was crackling and the film I wanted to watch, Cleopatra, (with the desperate hope of killing 4 hours of time) wasn't working, it was just a black screen with audio. After travelling long haul last year to Tokyo with another European airline, I could clearly detect a startling difference with the way economy passengers are treated on BA. Within 10 minutes of takeoff the other airline cabin crew handed out bottles of water and bags of pretzels to customers. On BA we had to wait at least 30 minutes before being offered a drink. On this particular flight staff seemed unfriendly and unapproachable and there seemed to be a general contempt for economy travellers.

I wanted to retrieve my membership number and password, which proved impossible over three months of trying. When asked to enter my name it would reply ""Please enter an English name.""  When I called customer service in Bangkok there was no reply ever. Cabin is nice, but small and cramped feeling, the herringbone arrangement is good but there is little privacy and the seats are narrow and not particularly comfortable. I am tall and have a disability so I'm not their ideal customer! There is no turn down service or mattress, so you have a blanket and have to put that down and sleep on top of it. The food was worse, though. As I recall, EVA always had great food and maybe Covid has impacted this. Bangkok-London offerings. Presentation is fine, we got a beef dish with a potato gratin that had a strange scent. My bead was microwaved plastic. The hostesses quietly apologized.

1671,"Me and my daughter were in Cyprus and could not leave on our Qatar Airways return ticket from Melbourne to Larnaca due to the Covid19 lockdown. However we managed to get on a UK charter flight to Manchester via Doha to Melbourne recently. This review should really cover the Manchester to Melbourne flight via Doha. We required wheelchair assistance and medical oxygen so it was not a straight forward flight. We have so many people to thank and especially Qatar Airlines which will be the subject of the review here. Customer service was excellent. Qatar Cyprus (Eleni) reached out to us to assist us. Qatar Airways waived all charges for changing the route completely. Once they approved the wheelchair and oxygen they swung into action, we had excellent assistance from Check in to boarding and then disembarking. We were told many times that they will take care of the medical needs by the cabin crew who checked on us frequently during the flight. At Doha, we were picked up and transported to the different gates effortlessly and efficiently and were allowed to stop to get some sandwiches We have nothing but the utmost praise for the cabin crew (Flights QR 28 and QR 904 11th May 2020) for looking after us. Safety due to virus From videos to cleaning the toilets frequently and wearing the appropriate safety gear, they kept us safe during the flight. It can't be easy on the cabin crew as they are exposed to passengers all the time so they are like frontline healthcare professionals. My deep respect for the cabin crews. Qatar Airways - We will get you home (catch cry at the moment). Thank you Qatar for getting us home. Whilst most major airlines abandoned us, you kept flying. You upgraded your safety levels to manage the virus and you kept flying. You are the only major airline that kept flying to Australia. You deserve an award for this. Thank you for flying and as one of your ground staff in Doha said ""Qatar will always keep flying no matter what"".

On boarding the aircraft with my cane I was told where my seat was, and nothing else. I had no access to safety instructions or menus. No access to entertainment system, no knowledge of where toilets were and no access to help button. I did not know how my chair worked. I was completely ignored on the outbound flight. A complaint was made and I was advised my return flight I would be made comfortable, that I would have my needs taken into account. This was not the case, again the seating was not appropriate even though promised. Singapore Airlines did not fulfill their commitment to make ""reasonable adjustments"" to ensure my safety or comfort onboard their aircrafts. I could not see or hear as both main flights were night flights. I could not use the toilets as I wasn't told where they are. The crew outbound had no concern for my safety or comfort. I was denied access to all inflight entertainment and felt unable to leave my seat for 13 hours. This is totally unacceptable.

She was mortified as it was a new scooter costing around Â£1800 and she does not have a lot of money so buying a new one is not so easy. She was taken to one of there offices were the person dealing with this matter told her not to worry at all and that they would get the scooter repaired ASAP and that she should take it back home with here and they would arrange collection. We then got a call from someone saying that they will not be collecting it but instead they asked my disabled mother to take the scooter to a repair shop, get a quote and send it to them and then they will pay for the repair. We did that and after 2 some time they got back to us saying that what we sent them was a quote and they need an invoice even though they asked for a writen quote. Anyway we send the invoice with a long message saying please try to resolve this quickly as my mother in confined until she gets her scooter back. They then replained with a one sentence answer saying 'We cannot evaluate this document. Thank you for your understanding'. Understand what, there was no explanation. I then had to call them, spent half an hour explaining the situation and they said it was because it was not an invoice, even though it clearly was. We then had to go back to the workshop and got them it change the invoice and sent it again. And there reply, you guessed it 'We cannot evaluate this document. Thank you for your understanding'. So again we called them up and this time they said because the invoice was not stamped by the company. Spoke to the company again, who at this point is fed up of us, and they singed the invoice as they do not have a stamp but told us they have sent many invoices and have never had this issue before. Sent the invoice again and there response 'We cannot evaluate this document. Thank you for your understanding'. We replied saying if you are not happy still with the invoice then can you arrange for a another repair shop to do the shop and there are no other places and my mother can not drive due to her disability and the scooter is extremely heavy.

3400,"Bangkok to Brussels via Dubai. I've flown them roughly every three years or so for the last two decades and they seem as good as ever. They're not perfect, and some other carriers have done a good job of catching up (particularly in economy class) but Emirates is still one of the better choices. The check in team and gate agents are efficient and patient. I had a problem with my mobile boarding pass not scanning and they were able to print me a new paper one with a smile. The aircraft was an older 777, but still mostly functional--there was a problem with the seat recline on my second segment. The entertainment system is good, but trying to cater to every culture they serve means the pool of options for English is pretty shallow. I was able to keep myself entertained, but just barely. Comedy is a weak spot for sure. The two hours of free wifi is good, but the connection is pretty poor. Emirates food is decent, though one flight only had an option of lamb or cod. Those are both rather specific tastes, I'd have been happier if they had gone with at least one safer choice of beef, chicken, or pasta. But the food was good and the desserts definitely stand out. Emirates doesn't stack up to the Asian carriers in terms of frequently circulating with water between meals, but the crew seemed service focused enough that you would get some if you asked. Connecting in Dubai is not a great experience. It's not as horrible as Doha but there is an amazing lack of plumbing in the airport, ensuring long lines at the toilets. Add to that some really extensive walks to get from gate to gate, and I'd be wary of advising any mobility impaired friends to try this without assistance. The flights were close to on time, but both arrived a little bit late without any logical explanation--no headwinds, ATC delays, or other obvious issues.

I entered all the relevant info and managed to check in all my party, myself, my wife, my younger son 13 who has Downs Syndrome and was marked for special assistance, my elder son 17 and his friend, also 17 years old. I received the relevant confirmation in an email stating clearly that my party of 5 were all checked in and were allocated seats A to E in row 23, flight TK4330. I went to print off the boarding passes and was only able to print off mine and my elder sons but on clicking the other members of my group a message was displayed stating that boarding passes were unavailable right now but they would be available to collect at the Turkish Airlines check in desk. I tried from my laptop, my ipad using the Turkish Airlines App and my son's friends android phone again using the app. Each time I was prompted with the same message stating that each of the 3 other boarding passes would be available at the check in counter. As an IT Systems professional, this did not trigger any alarm bells, no error message was displayed and the message was very concise and clear. I also had the email confirmation. The following day when I arrived at the check in counter I was told abruptly that only myself and my elder son could board the flight and the other 3 members of my party, my wife, my sons friend and my 13 year old would have to go to the sales desk to purchase new tickets for the flight the following day. As a seasoned traveller this was the most difficult situation I had ever encountered. I politely told the Turkish Airline staff at the desk that there was no chance of that happening. I explained to them very concisely what had happened and they still very unhelpful. I showed them the email confirmation and pointed out where it clearly stated that each passenger was check in and allocated a seat. They still weren't having any of it even though I pointed out that we had special assistance for my child who was now becoming very uncomfortable and visibly upset. I told them there was no way I was going to leave my wife, child and my sons friend and asked to speak to their supervisor. It was at this point they made a few phone calls and magically found 3 seats on the packed plane. On printing the boarding passes and handing them over the staff were visibly shamed and would not make any eye contact. We later learnt that Turkish Airlines had sold our missing 3 tickets to UK travellers (at a very handsome profit) who had missed their Gatwick flight. Does it get any more disgraceful than this.

In all the airlines that we flew this food is much better than the standard meal. But in the case of Turkish Airlines, our special meal was simply inedible. This special meal given to us looked much worse than the standard nutrition. We just could not eat anything and flew hungry all our flights â in two ways! I remember that in my meal there was a lot of fiber, which I cannot eat. This is incompatible with the concept of the Bland meal (BLML) diet.",handicap,1,agreed,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

But first, the Premium Economy section toilet was broken, so we had to go way down the back of the plane and stand in long queues to use the loo. There was no salt and pepper. We asked, they said ok. It never came. We asked for water and got two cups of warm water. We were told there was no ice cream choice, chocolate or nothing, and then they served strawberry to the rear. They did not distribute immigration forms for Hong Kong, which delayed our processing, and which is inexcusable slackness. The tea is poor. The seats have a rigid divider, so when I needed to exit from my window seat I could not get past the man lying all the way back in the row in front and refusing to lift his seat for me. For all that I arrived in OK shape and had a safe and comfortable trip. Check in was efficient and friendly, I was a priority client needing a wheelchair and all of that was fine, albeit with a few reminders to the crew that a wheelchair was required on arrival in HK. I needed oxygen half way across, due to the long walk back from the loo and the struggle under the seat as described above, as I have a respiratory condition, the air was thin and I  was severely oxygen depleted, and the crew were marvelous about that. The seats were very comfortable for 12 hours (unlike the business class seats, which were bad for the backside, on our trip over to Europe).",handicap,1,agreed,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

I was expecting the wheelchair transfers in Dubai to be the usual high standard. Instead of a wheelchair waiting for me as the aircraft opened its doors in Dubai, I was told to walk along the sky bridge and to find a desk that would then provide a wheelchair. I did this and found a group of men who were obviously employed to provide wheelchair assistance standing around talking to each other and did not seem to have any list of passengers who required this assistance. I was told there were not enough wheelchairs and told to walk to another area where there was no seating and I had to stand until an assistant arrived with a wheelchair. I sat in this while we went from one building to another and in the airport train. I was unceremoniously dumped at the seating area at the gate and a very long walk down a corridor and onto the skybridge awaited me. The woman sitting next to me kindly asked it I would like to lean on her arm as we traversed this onto the aircraft. I don't know what would have happened if I had been unable to walk at all. The return trip from Johannesburg to Bangkok was even worse. When we landed in Dubai there were no wheelchairs and I was asked to walk a long distance and up an escalator to an area of seating and told to wait for a golf cart. This did not appear. I was sitting next to a woman whose mobility was even worse than mine and she was in a great deal of pain. We were then told we had to walk to some other area, so the woman and I shuffled off leaning on each other vowing never to fly with Emirates again. This time we were told to wait in an area with no seats at all for a golf cart. I noticed a folded wheelchair up against a wall so I unfolded it and put my companion in it. She was most grateful. No assistance at all from the employees whose job it was to provide assistance. Eventually a golf cart came and I got in. Then there were discussions amongst the so-called assistants, and I was told to get out and wait for a different golf cart. I was the only one in this golf cart and was dumped at the correct gate where I had to walk down the sky bridge to the plane. As I get older I will increasingly need to require wheelchair assistance when I travel alone. But the appalling way I and others were treated at Dubai Airport will certainly influence me when I choose which airline to fly in the future. I go to Africa regularly.

What stood out for me was the absolute high quality of service, both on the ground and in the air.

The flight schedule was changed and instead of 3 hours bearable lay-over, now there was a 11 hour lay-over. They gave hotel accommodation but I was still worried due to my motherâs health and age.  While returning from DFW and reaching DXB, they told my mother that she doesnât have wheelchair booked. Due to less passengers, upon asking for help, they agreed to provide her wheelchair but what if the flight was packed? Strike 3: I talked to customer service about their initial refusal to provide a wheelchair and they had no answer but âHer wheelchair is bookedâ. So I asked customer service for the instructions that my mother should follow to get back to the airport from hotel and again the only answer to all my questions was âOur staff will be there to assist her everywhereâ. After her hotel stay, my mother was dropped at the road-side of the airport with nobody to help. She asked questions to the passing-by people and thank God she was able to find her way into the airport wheelchair counter.

All they offer is booking a wheelchair. How are you supposed to push somebody in a wheelchair while also carrying two handbags, a trolley and a guitar. Other airports/airlines have buggies at their disposal. Considering that some gates are 15 minutes walk, this is pretty poor. When flying from an apron gate (7xx e.g. 700), there are no business class buses for business class travelers and you're expected to stand in the bus for 20 minutes or so while it fills up until people step onto each others toes and everybody is squashed in. When questioning the ground staff on why there is no business class bus unlike like we were told at check-in, they said 'economics' and that business class buses are only available for incoming and domestic flights - very poor show. My overall rating of 6 explained: - on-board service & food: 8 - on-board cleanliness of toilets: 5 (floor's often wet) - lounge services & food: 8 - male lounge staff: 5 (often loud or shouting across the room) - female lounge staff: 9 - ground services (bus/transport): 0",handicap,1,agreed,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

5696,"On a recent âround-tripâ experience, Denpasar - Budapest, I found myself in multiple disappointing (borderline traumatic) situations with Turkish Airlines. When checking in on my return flight in Budapest in May, 2018, I was told that my return ticket had been cancelled. As a result, I was forced to pay an additional $1,600 to purchase a new one-way ticket on the same flight. Below is a description of what had happened. In April, on the third leg of my flight from Denpasar to Budapest, I missed the flight in Istanbul due to confusion at the gate - poor communication and gate location (ie. heavy traffic surrounding this specific gate, the sitting area hosted multiple flights, unclear instructions and lack of announcements, etc). I had been sitting at the gate for an hour when they started boarding, but was only alerted when priority boarding started --- no more announcements or callouts were made thereafter. When the line began to peter out I started to get a bit concerned, but because there were still so many people sitting around me, which I had presumed they were waiting for the same plane, and no final announcements or staff had called out, I didnât move forward. However, at that time I did ask the people around me what flight they were waiting for, but they just shook their heads and said they did not speak English. At this point I was growing quite concerned and so I ran to the closest Turkish Airlines staff I could find, at a nearby counter. When I showed him my ticket, he began shouting (actually) at me and said that the gate was now closed and I had to go downstairs to the transfers desk. This was only a minute or two after the gate had been closed. I ran downstairs, showed them my ticket and asked what could be done. They said that I had to purchase a new ticket - no alternative was given. To do so, they ordered me to purchase a visa and exit through customs. When outside, I first rushed to ticketing at Turkish Airlines where an employee stated that I had to purchase a new ticket, but that he could not do anything for me and to go see the Turkish Airlines check-in desk. I then proceeded to the check-in desk at Turkish Airlines and they said that I had to purchase a new ticket. At no time I was told that this would render my return flight invalid, and no other information was given. I tried the help-phone for Turkish Airlines as well, but there was no dial tone and no-one was in the area to provide assistance. I finally had to purchase a one way ticket from Istanbul to Budapest for 200 Euros for a flight later that day. To add insult to injury, the Turkish Airlines staff was appalling - I was yelled at and belittled on numerous occasions. I've read other reviews and some have said that Turkish Airlines employees are inhumane, and to be honest, I agree - note: this is specific to the Istanbul Airport staff. My original ticket was over $1,400, and this whole ordeal has cost me an additional $2000. I reached out to Turkish Airlines and although they responded in a timely fashion, they were unhelpful and clearly had not read my story. Furthermore, the avenue of communication they use - feedback forms only, make it very difficult to communicate with them. I suppose that is what they want!",handicap,0,llm_validated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

3547,"Dubai to Houston. I have never experienced such a complete & total lack of professionalism, by any airline. Travelers can encounter a problem on any airline, but it is how an airline handles a problem that is most important. This experience on EK was a ""case study in abject incompetence"". The flight was boarded on time, but departure time came & went, & passengers were left sitting, with zero flight deck contact for almost 1.5 hours before the 1st contact by The Captain. There had been a problem with a smoke detector in the crew's sleeping cabin, but it would soon be fixed & we would be ""on our way in about 15 minutes"". Yet again, we sat with no update k for over another hour, by which time the flight was 2.5 hours late. The Captain then made a 2nd announcement that it had taken longer to fix the problem than anticipated, but we would ""now depart in about 10-15 minutes"". However, for a 3rd time, passengers were left sitting another 1+ hour with no flight deck contact. What kind of flight crew training does EK provide, where a Captain thinks it is OK to let passengers sit in silence on a flight delayed 3+ hours, yet make only 2 incorrect announcements? After sitting for 3.5 hours the Captain direct all passengers to collect their belongings & deplane. So 100's of passengers deplane, but those in 1st & Business Class on the upper deck had another surprise waiting. Neither the Captain, or the flight crew had alerted ground staff that upper deck passengers had been directed to deplane. As a result, all 1st & Business Class passengers were crammed at the end of the jetway in front of the 2nd floor elevators, with no place to go! Passengers could enter the elevators, but security had disabled the floor selection buttons after the plane had originally boarded. Passengers started to bang on the glass walls to try & get the attention of security staff who could be seen in the distance, but unable to hear through the heavy glass walls. Passengers finally returned to the plane to tell the ""totally clueless"" flight crew, there was no place to go & passengers were trapped in the small  2nd floor area. Security personnel finally noticed passengers banging on the wall & 1 unlocked a 5th floor door & came to the 2nd level via stairwell, since they also could not operate the elevators. This employee then directed all 1st & Business Class passengers to carry all their belongings up 6 flights to the 5th floor Business Class Lounge! What a fiasco of total incompetence. The flight ended up being 5.5 hours late, but once airborne, passengers quickly learned that even though the plane had sat at the gate for almost 6 hours, it had not been re-catered, so the flight was serving a ""breakfast"" menu, even though the flight departed at almost 4:00PM. No dinner would be served, but rather a light snack, since the menu was still for the ""original"" flight times. After flying for 25 years, I have never experienced a more incompetent flight operation.

For unknown (according to Thailand Doctors) reason my father died on the plane and the plane made an emergency landing in Phuket Thailand. They sent my dead father and mother to the hospital by ambulance even though he was dead for a couple of hours. We received one phone call by the hostess to say they were being taken to hospital and confirming my father had died already even though Turkish airlines have in their reports that he died in hospital. I'm guessing to avoid any responsibility. For the next several hours, every family member including grandkids were calling Phuket hospitals trying to find my mother. Imagine your 72 year old mother who has severe asthma, Crohn's disease and has had triple heart by-pass surgery stuck in a foreign country with high humidity with limited English. No thanks to Turkish airlines we tracked down my parents to a hospital ourselves. We are grateful for the Thai people whom were very nice to my mother. They police took her to the hotel across the road which was kind of them. However, my mother who had just lost her husband of nearly 55 years, in complete numbness and shock had to stay 3 nights in Thailand until a negative Covid test came back. That was the earliest I was able to get my mother out of there. Costs - Hotel & food about $300, Covid test $200, Compulsory Insurance during the brief stay $300. Now comes to my father, I received an invoice to the amount around $5,760 which around $2,500 was to go to Turkish Airlines fees to repatriate my father back to Turkey. We asked Turkish airlines to take some responsibility and at least waive their fees. They said no. So family members chipped in and paid the total bill. And even though Turkish airlines is profiting by $2,500, they have not apologised and accepted any responsibility in the way my mother was dumped and treated, not to mention keeping family members in the dark.

Two of the girls working there...  want them as life long friends. Beautiful, helpful, kind people. Everything. They have a roof to terrace. Great spot, great view.

The location is just off a highway. I was worried when we pulled up. Be reminded that Vietnam is busy, there&#39;s a lot of people there. There will be some residual background noise, but you&#39;ll get that wherever you sleep in Vietnam. Still book this hotel. The only strange thing about our room - it had a tub and it was really high off the ground - &quot;difficult&quot; to get in and out of. It was slippery, we had to lay a towel down, and there was no curtain or door, so water went everywhere. That&#39;s it.

There are a few steps down from the street to the entrance and also a ramp , which we used.  Lifts to all floors.  Breakfast was excellent with hot bacon, sausage, hash browns, beans, grilled tomato and egg....(only scrambled).   Toast, croissants and bagels etc and all cereals, fruit, yoghurt etc. but we only had hot breakfast and pastries.

We arrived early at 1.30pm but we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel until 3pm check in.  We returned after 4pm to find reception very busy and there was a bit of a mix up with our room; however, Caitlin dealt with this admirably and professionally and we were happily in our room within ten minutes.  On leaving we also were able to leave our luggage after checking out as our train wasn&#39;t for another 5 hours.  All staff were friendly, helpful and kind. The power point for use of hair appliances at the desk was very close to the kettle which was a little tricky and maybe not too safe as the appliance cord somtimes touched the kettle.

The housekeeper was very accommodating although there was a language barrier (particularly when it comes to money) as he doesn&#39;t speak English so we spoke via Google translate. They did my laundry on request. Muhamad and his sons own the hotel and Muhamad was very welcoming, he knocked on my door on the morning after my arrival and took me on a full day private tour of Egypt at an additional cost of $250 USD (not including tips). A simple continental breakfast is provided at a time you request (bread, cheese, ham, a boiled egg). Nice balcony view of the garden. Very peaceful place as it&#39;s in a private compound away from the streets. It is not a hotel but rather a guarded compound whereby you stay in a house with other guests and a housekeeper and you get your own private bedroom and ensuite which is lockable (the rest of the house is shared living space). There is no reception and the housekeeper takes photos of your passport on his phone (for security purposes) on arrival, which gets sent to all of the hotel owners&#39; phones (not an overly secure form of storing people&#39;s information). From a cleanliness point of view I could see other people&#39;s hairs in the bed linen and the fridge had small spots of mould so I didn&#39;t use it. The shower is in a tall bath with no shower screen, so water floods the tiles and it is quite slippery (would be dangerous for people with mobility issues). Need to catch taxi&#39;s&#47;private transport to get anywhere as the inn is in a more secluded area of Egypt away from the city and it is a 1 hour drive to the airport. No swimming pool.

Everything is locked and empty. There is no concierge to ask questions, nowhere to leave luggage, no usual &quot;hotel&quot; type amenities. Parking is in the public city lots which range from 1 block to 6 blocks away depending on which building you&#39;re in, and which can be expensive. Also, you&#39;re not guaranteed a spot.

Also despite traveling with a service animal (I'm hearing impaired) and clearly stating that in my reservation, I was put into one of the rooms at the end of the hallway that are designated for those with pets. A neighbor had a dog that would stop barking and my dog, who alerts me when someone is at the door, spent much of the night alerting me to the sound of the side door (next to our room) opening and closing.

879,"Bad: Nothing to dislike at all!. Good: As a first time visitor to Chicago, the hotel was an excellent central location from which to explore. Firstly, the property, services, cleanliness, wifi and staff were very good. As mentioned by other users, there is a continental buffet served on a credenza on each floor outside the elevators from around 6.30 am. Some may want a more sumptuous offering, but this is a very generous continental breakfast and would be more than sufficient for most. Travelling to the hotel from O'Hare was simple. If you can read and follow English signs, it's an easy and cheap transition on the Blue Line public train into town. The hotel website gives precise information on which stop to disembark and the 5-10 minute walk to the property. Probably a better option to use taxis, Uber etc if you are travelling with lots of luggage or you have mobility issues. As for food and entertainment, the hotel is surrounded by excellent options. Restaurants and bars of all types abound. The House of Blues is right across the road for example. River Walk is also a highlight and is only a 3 minute walk away. The hotel area is well serviced by public transport and taxis, plus the first stop of Hop On/Hop Off Bus tour company is 5 minutes away in front of the Trump Building. As in other cities and countries that offer this service, it's an excellent way to get a quick feel for a new place, and Chicago is a stunning place to visit. By the way, Buddy Guy's Legends Bar is well worth a visit. People will always have various expectations, but I found the staff, service, amenities, and most of all the music on the night, to be fabulous as a musician and huge blues fan, this was a big tick on my personal bucket list. The H.O.B was also great, but didn't have time to get down to Rosa's Bar or Kingston Mines.

1076,"Stayed here twice in the past 2 weeks. Accessible room both times. First the bad - I called the hotel within 45 minutes of checking out - very early morning. I realized I had left my ring on the table next to the bed and asked if they could please check on it immediately. They promised to call me back - they never did. Due to my early checkout and my prompt call, I doubt the cleaning staff had even entered the room. So, I'm very unhappy about the ring - nothing overly expensive, but it did have some sentimental value.Accessible rooms themselves were much more adequate than most - we have a lot of experience in this area, and many accessible rooms are NOT truly accessible. For our second stay we were given a room that was on the top floor and the furthest room from the elevator. In an emergency, we would have never gotten out of that hotel. My husband is in a wheelchair. There is no way we would have made it down 9 flights of stairs, and trying to get 2 children and a manual wheelchair to the elevator was tiring and difficult. WHY don't hotels use a little common sense and realize that accessible rooms on LOWER floors would be more logical We were offered no assistance with luggage either stay.A huge plus for this hotel is that they are one of the very few hotels in Philadelphia that offer 2 Queen beds in a room. However, I was told by the front desk staff that none of the Queen rooms face the street. So, the windows in these rooms basically face other 'inside' rooms and offer very little light. The hotel is fairly new, so the rooms do not have the tired and worn appearance that many hotels in Philadelphia do.Location for this hotel is very good. Very close to Jefferson University Hospital, Chinatown, Magee Rehabilitation hospital, restaurants, city hall, etc. Breakfast leaves a lot to be desired, but then again, yogurt, cereal, juice, beats 40+ for a family breakfast at a restaurant each day. I would do away with the microwave items altogether though.Price was very good, location great.

They changed the name on the reservation, they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from 109 to 129 We booked in Oct but 1st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodel...but the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked. Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck. There was 4 or 6 couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lot.Our 1st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess, floorboards missing, walls messed up, the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc. I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etc.It was late about 10:30 and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming. So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat. He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other building.We do and its a bigger mess then the 1st building. There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too, the 2nd building is old,smells and needs remodel bad. The new room is 2 bedroom but its hit and miss, way to much furniture, kitchen is dated, microwave falling down, dusty and dirty and about a 3 gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wanted.When we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the 1st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel. We book next time at Hilton.Was really disappointed that management didn't reach out to us in till we contacted them.John Dominguez Assistant GM useless!Thank you for rating us on trip advisor as we are always looking to improve our hotel and do well by all of our guests. As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property: however, we always have a manager on duty.As we are currently undergoing renovations, we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests. We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay. My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stay.Im happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room. We are sorry that you declined it. My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed. The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred. In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving. As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet. As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made. Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable. We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that. As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests. We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms. again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect.

I was made aware of this situation and have since reviewed ADA policy in regards to service animals, with all my front desk staff. I'm sorry you felt uncomfortable while staying with us, that is certainly not our objective. We are a hotel that does not allow pets, but service animals are not considered Pets by the ADA. We like any other business, are required by law to allow all animals being identified as service animals entry into the building. I apologize if one of my staff members took the questions too far or simply didn't understand the policy. Feel free to contact me directly should you want to discuss this matter further.

The room was absolutely perfect. It was big clean. We had a 2 bedroom unit which was perfect for privacy yet allowed us to be nearby. The bed was super comfortable we loved having 48flat screens in each room. The room was bright sunny we enjoyed being able to open the window. We requested a shower chair it was promptly brought to the room. Breakfast was great I was able to bring a tray of healthy options upstairs too. We enjoyed the work out facility it was bright clean had all of the equipment that we usually use. The location was beautiful easy to get to. we can't wait to stay again!Thank you for your feedback.

We got the room with Marriott points, but would have otherwise spent the 269 for this prime location. It is away from the craziness of the Pike's place wharf but 10min from downtown on the trolley (1 per day for seniors) Seattle Rapid Transit is light years ahead of the rest of the U.S. --safe, clean, wheelchair access, and ON TIME!Although on points, hotel management quickly moved us to another room when we asked for a little less road noise. The in-house Starbucks Coffee was a plus. The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. The desk staff were extremely tourist friendly readily giving tips and directions. Three budget eateries are a block away, but the staff knows the better dining venues as well. Just walking along Lake Union is a treat with the float planes, marinas and swimmers.This hotel will be our retreat whenever we visit Seattle in the future.Dear Douglas D,Thank you for your comments.

8030,"We stayed the week before Christmas 2014 and asked for a room with an interior courtyard, window view. Intention was to keep street noise to a minimum. Location of the hotel is on Decatur street and in the middle of the north and south borders of the French Quarter. This makes it 3 blocks from the middle of Bourbon street, 2 blocks from Royal street, which is where a lot of the boutiques, art shops, and museums are, 2 blocks from Jackson Square and as far as possible from Louis Armstrong Park. We were warned that Louis Armstrong Park is not safe to be around after dark. The hotel's location also puts you with 1 block of the contemporary shopping near the Mississippi River if that interests you.First, know that the hotel is a composite of 5 different buildings, each with their own specifics, that have been combined into one hotel. Courtyard is paved stone and very nice. Pool is not heated. WiFi is available throughout the property. Most of the property pictures show a great walk-in stand up shower big enough for 2 people but be aware that not all the rooms have that. Some of the rooms have a standard tub/shower.The first room (2nd floor) we were given was very big with lots of floor space but was right next to a noisy elevator and was audible even with the shower on and there was a drip that could be heard in the bathroom vent that was most likely from condensation. Second room offered (2nd floor) required a walk up a flight of stairs as there was not an elevator that connected to the outside balcony. This is why you need to check which room you are getting if you have any trouble maneuvering stairs cause of age or know ahead of time you will be drinking.Third, fourth, and fifth rooms were tiny boxes and felt claustrophobic there was now outside window. With a queen size bed and 2 side tables, available floor space was minimal. You could stand at the food of the bed and touch the wall where the flat screen television was mounted. These rooms were accessible to an interior elevator and hallway.Sixth room was acceptable but we had to give up the nice stand-up shower for a regular tub. There was walking space in the room but it was only partially accessible from the elevator. Luggage was carried another 40' to the room by way of a balcony walkway.the woman at the registration was very helpful to let us check the rooms out before settling on one.The next day we were able to switch to a vacated room. This room was the best. It was large enough that it would take 4 twin beds to fill the floor space. Queen bed, 2 side tables, bench at the foot of the bed, armchair with reading table and lamp, and stand up shower. These are the attached pictures.Again, review the room when you arrive as the prices won't help you discern which room is which.",handicap,1,agreed,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
5663,"The hotel overall is a great facility. I liked the room and the size of the room. The room was a little dated and the beds were very uncomfortable, but they are currently going through a renovation, so this should not be a problem much longer. My main issue was the service. My first impression of the hotel is what I would call the valet mafia. I just wanted to leave my car out front long enough to get checked into the hotel. The valet made me give him my key. There were several cars parked out front, which I later realized were valet customers whose cars were staying in front of the hotel and would not be moved. The check in staff was very nice and courteous. Very thorough explaining all their policies, etc. When I went back outside to move my car, I had to wait on my keys and it was obvious they were expecting a tip. After we got into our room, it was late, so we decided to just go to the restaurant in the hotel, Medici. Service was awful and we seemed to be an inconvenience for our waiter. Both mornings at breakfast in the Atrium Cafe, we received the same type of service. On Saturday evening, after returning from dinner, parking was a nightmare. Valet had taken all of the handicapped parking places at the hotel we were told we had to park in the deck which is a very long walk back through the hotel to the lobby elevators. This is not acceptable. But, my worst experience was in the lobby the morning of our check out. Apparently a guest had some type of issue. I do not know what it was, but a hotel employee (I think they were from the food service staff, maybe a chef) was working with them and appeared very put out with the guest. Situations like this happen, but what I found totally unprofessional was after hotel employee spoke with the guest again and coming to no solution, he walked back over the the front desk and told the front desk person that he was not dealing with this --. Totally unprofessional.Thank you so much for taking the time to give us your feedback, it is very helpful to hear about the experience our customers have had. I am very dissapointed with what you have described, particularly with the service in my hotel. It is not typical and I would like to learn more to enable me to follow through on your experience. If possible I would like to speak to you to learn more details. I can be reached at 770 303 3186.

Checked in, and 30 minutes later checked out. This hotel had cockroaches, the room we were given was filthy, a visiting prostitute went to the room next door whilst we stood and watched. 3 attempts to gain entry to our room resulted in the handy man coming with master key. And to add insult to injury the dirt and grime was so thick it made me ill. There was one wash cloth, one hand towel, and 2 bath towels.

7798,"Pros: excellent location. Directly across from Seattle ctr. Space needle was directly outside of my window which was a nice view. The room is nice and spacious. Breakfast is good. The stop is nice and efficient. There's truly no reason to rent a car staying at this location. Most things are within walking distance all within about a mile. And the hotel offer shuttle service within 1 mile. Cons: My room was located directly off of the elevator which was allowed in the middle the night when people were getting back again. My son and myself are woke up each night due to the noise. The room was in need of some minor repairs which in my opinion should've been taken care of prior to the room being rented out. Things such as some touch up paint, a broken doorstop on the floor which my son picked up and tried to eat with the screw hanging out of the bottom of it, and a broken hand rail inside the shower on the door which was left hanging. Breakfast on the weekend as far as the omelette station goes is extremely slow because there is only one person making omelettes. We were told it would take 25 minutes and after 40 we still had not received our omelettes, nor did we ever receive our omelettes that day. We rented a car because it was our first time here. If you have to rent a car the parking garage is rather strange and the spots are tight. Your spot is assigned so forewarning, there are some spots such as 19, you guessed it, my spot! which is ridiculous. This spot not only has a huge pile which lands right at your door so you can't get out and if they place ppl in the spots slightly behind you then you can't get out even in a small car because these spots are caddy corner/ next to this spot making it impossible to get out of unless you have a motorcycle......... and for al this hassle you pay 25 per night!!!!! Lastly, I did not like how there are only two elevators with this hotel which are rather small which wouldn't be a problem if it were only the guest using but. The employees try to get on them with the guest with their cleaning carts, dirty linens, food carts, etc. so if you are A guest with luggage, wheelchair, stroller, etc. it is a very tight squeeze on the elevator. And the employees are insistent on getting on with you instead of waiting for the next one. Many times we were cramped in the elevator due to this.",handicap,1,llm_validated,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1

When we got to the hotel everyone was nice and the room was spacious. In the morning, being that most are up early and running over to Disneyland, it did get a little loud but that is because there were excited children. Who could blame them. We were going to Disneyland as well. The beds were comfortable but when you sat on them it sounded like you were passing gas. We thought it was funny however it could annoy others. For the price we paid this is a great hotel if you are going to Disneyland, are trying to be close to the front gates, and don't mind noise at 7am. I think my only suggestion for the hotel is to find a better location for their breakfast and to offer higher quality items.

For starters they advertise to give shuttles to the parks however that shuttle service is one drop off time and a few pick up times. We were going to Universal Studio which opens at 10 but the shuttle doesnt leave until 10:45. The park closes at 8 but the shuttle picks up at 7:15 and 10:15. However Universal studios is in walking distance, so we choice to walk. It took us about 20 minutes to walk along with a wheelchair, so many may be able to walk faster. Also the shuttle require a 24 hour notice for wheelchairs. So since we didnt know exactly when we would need them ahead of time we were not able to use their shuttle.We started in room 275. We let the front desk know that we needed a fridge, as we have meds that have to be kept cold, and they did get us a fridge. The fridge does keep things cold but doesnt seal on top. You can put your finger right into the fridge. So we put a towel on top to help keep things out and the fridge cold. Fridges and Microwaves are available for an extra 10 charge. However, the next day, we found some uninvited bugs in our room. Not the end of world but I really am bug-a-phobic. I called the front desk and asked them to send someone to spray while we were out. When we got back they had the fan on in the bathroom and we didnt see anything.. But the next morning we I had to turn the light on for the bathroom we found more. We quickly got dress as we kept finding more and my husband went to speak the manager. We were asked to wait a half hour for the manager to come in. Half hour later, the manager was in a meeting so my husband told the front desk lady the issues. They called in a contractor to spray and moved us to room 105. The new room was much bigger and nicer looking. Plus it had a table and two chairs which was not in the other room.The door to room 275 didnt really seal at all. You could see the light from outside and pizza places where putting ads/coupons in the door frames. The ads would come right through the right side of the door and fall to floor a few feet in. In room 105 the door sealed better but there were people outside smoking and talking and you could totally hear them plus smell their smoking in the room. At least the ads got stuck in the door. Everything went ok after that except for toilet overflowing once. My husband quickly shut off the water to the toilet and we put down towels on the floor. I called the front desk and a lady came down to our room and asked what was wrong, although I explained it over the phone. They sent down the maintenance guy who just fixed the toilet. My husband asked if it was going to get cleaned up and we were told yes but that is housekeepings job. 15 minutes later we recalled the front desk and asked if someone was going to clean up the mess and bring us new towels. We had used towel to clean up the water. Housekeeping was around shortly after to cleanup and put in new towels. Other issue with the room beside it being run down was hearing everything that was going on outside.The hotel does not have a continental breakfast but they told us there is a Deli but we just went to Wal-Mart for quick breakfast foods. There is also 7-11 two spots down and Dennys and I-Hop are across the street.The interest is also issues at this hotel. There is Wi-Fi here but often the internet will not work. I know the issue is not my computer as my laptop is running just fine. I took the downtime to do extra maintenance work and write start to write this review.Our children did try the pool but shortly came back because they said it was cold and not that clean.. However it was a windy day so that may be why. Over all about a two star hotel which does have some issues but they are in the perfect location with Wet n Wild being about a block, Universal Studios in walking distance, and the I-trolley stop for SeaWorld and anything else on international drive as one the trolley I-ride stop is just across the street.

My problem had begun right after we sold our home and we had been staying in a wonderful Residence Inn in Holtsville NY for over 3 months and loved it! They even helped arrange our stay here in Dallas. We have not been disappointed! The staff is helpful and friendly beyond words! The first room they gave us, as we had asked for a top floor in a quiet corner, had bar stool seating, which in my condition, was a problem. I thought I'd be eating on a computer desk for our month's stay! But as soon as my husband just mentioned it at the desk, we were allowed to see a handicap accessible room which turned out to be perfect. The room is clean and user friendly. It has a small kitchen with a microwave and 2 burners and supplies. There are lots of amenities. It is very comfortable. There are lovely complimentary breakfasts each morning with a wonderful variety as well as complimentary dinners 4 nights a week! The dining area is bright and cheerful. There is a lovely sitting area with a couch and armchairs and fireplace. The property is well kept with a beautiful pool area with a hot whirlpool and barbecue. The location is wonderful and once we learned the area, we found we are close to all sorts of stores and markets as well as Target, Walmart and Whole Foods. However you need a car to reach them. There is free Internet access and a downstairs computer if you do not have your own. There is also an exercise room that I regretfully can not take advantage of!

We arrived late because we took the Amtrak from New York 36hrs we arrived at 21.30, very tired. Expecting a decent night sleep we were told they did not have a double room with a disabled friendly shower but a single room on the 7th Floor(they had elevators) with the correct shower. They asked was this acceptable We were so tired we said yes Ok. We were then informed that we would be charges an additional 50 per night for 12 nights for 'extras'. Extras we asked what extras/ Food, movies, drinks, breakfast.We were so tired we said OK. They then hit my card for 3000 - before leaving London we had agreed with our card company that no transaction would exceed 2800 as we had had stolen/lost cards in the past. We had forgotten this limit and the receptionist said the card was rejected. We could not work out why this had happened. So we paid for 1 night with the intention to sort the problem in the morning. However when we went up to the room we were delighted with the bathroom and felt that the size of the room was just about adequate. I was still upset about the card being rejected so I called the 'local' number of my bank. They confirmed there were no problems but reminded me of the limit I had set. As the room did not have a fridge or safe and as we were so tired I decided to deal with the problems in the morning. The following day I went to reception and the manager (i presume) allowed me to pay the bill account on 2 cards saying he understood why this had happened. I asked anbot a fridge he said it would be delivered. There was no safe available. I was not asked to pay the 'extra' this time so payment was made of a further 2200 split on the 2 cards. We went out and on our return found a fridge of 3ft square in the bedroom - so large that it hampered access to the bathroom. We had eaten out so thought we would watch a movie. The TV in our room refused to show us what was available so I rang reception - only no the line was still connected to my European Bamk on the local number. This phone call connection lasted 3 days.and paid 17.98 3minute . So, in spite of my disability I went down to reception and was told that they did not offer movies! As i had paid I could not afford to move and so we were stuck in this hotel. Finally on our last day no one helped with the luggage. I would write a lot but no more room We're glad you found the room size adequate and were delighted with the bathroom. I'm sorry to hear your bank gave you so much trouble with your credit card but happy to hear the desk manager was able to work around it. The reason you didn't have movies is because the 50.00 per night hold for incidentals (like movies, room charges, etc.) was waived due to the issues you were having with your bank and the monetary limits you had set. Also, (and again, in an effort to make you more comfortable) a fridge was placed in your room. I'm sorry to hear you thought it was too large but it's the smallest one we had. Additionally, your phone charges were waived when you didn't disconnect the International call. I am truly sorry to hear you did not enjoy your experience at the Whitney Hotel but it sounds like the staff went above and beyond to serve you and you were satisfied with the room so thank you again for mentioning that.

This hotel is not meant for disabled people or elderly, even those who have trouble walking up stairs or have bad knees. I had to carry all my suitcases up three flight of stairs just to get to my room. I even had to help two elderly people carry their suit cases up the stairs. The layout of the hotel map is confusing as it is. If anything the Hotel needs to add more elevators for each building and not only for two buildings. The only reason I booked this hotel was due to the lack of hotels during Comic Con. I won't be going to this hotel again.I am so sorry to hear you experienced inconveniences while getting around the property. This is not the kind of experience we want our guests to have. Our team can usually assist folks with luggage and getting to the room, as most hours we do have a bellman. Also, seven of our eight buildings have elevators.

9767,"Before I write this five star review, let me explain why my opinion matters. Me and my family have been coming to Disneyland about 4 times a year every year for about the last 10 years. We have stayed at multiple hotels near Disneyland and have a lot to compare with the Del Sol Inn. To name a few we have stayed at the Clarion, Desert Inn and Suites, both Super 8's, Eden Roc, Riviera, Best Western Stovall Inn, and many more. Del Sol Inn exceeds every hotel that I have stayed at in comfort, cleanliness, location, practicality, and value. As I am writing this I am enjoying my 4th visit in a row staying at this wonderful hotel.To start with the rooms are immaculately clean. They have a sleek contemporary look with a modern decor. They have shutters instead of curtains and crown molding through out the room. The vanity is made out of marble with a mirror that has a light built into it. The well stocked bathroom has subway style tiles on the floor and wall. The shower/tub is handicap friendly with a bar to help you get in and out of the shower. It has a curved shower rod which creates a little extra room. The shower water pressure is great. The shower head has lots of head clearance. My 6'6 son n law is currently staying with me at the Del Sol Inn and he says he has plenty of head clearance. I have always had comfortable beds and pillows everytime I have stayed here. The rooms come with a fridge, coffee maker, blow dryer, flat screen TV with cable, wifi, and plenty of storage. We like to stay in the room that has 2 queens and a bunk bed set. This room also comes with a desk. There are multiple easily accessible electric outlets throughout the room. There is also multiple sources of light including both bunk beds have their own lights (my kids really like that feature). I rented a scooter and there is plenty of space in the room to store it without getting in the way.Del Sol Inn has a very well maintained heated pool and hot tub. It is surrounded by lounge chairs. It is a really nice spot to watch the Disneyland fireworks show from. They offer a free continental breakfast that comes with waffles, cereal, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, donuts, fruit, juice, coffee, and milk. They have a friendly English speaking staff. They are always willing to store my bags for free until check in and sometimes have been able to get me my room early.Del Sol Inn is also a very practical hotel choice. To start with it is directly across the street, about a 3 min walk to the gate. This hotel is closer to Disneyland than both the Disneyland hotel and Disney's Paradise Peir hotel. This has been perfect with my 2 year old granddaughter because it is so easy to come back to the hotel for a mid day break. It is also right next to a little market that sells a few groceries, snacks, medicine, and other items you might need. Two hotels down there is select mobility where you can rent scooters for 35/ a day. Del Sol Inn also shares a parking lot with Dennys. There is a Ihop, McDonald's, cold stone ice cream, Captain kidds buffet all within a minutes walk.Out of all the hotels we have stayed at this has been the best one. The only way you could find a hotel that is on par with the Del Sol Inn in terms of location, cleanliness, and amenities is by staying at a Disney hotel, but the price will start at about 3x the price of a room at Del Sol Inn.If I was to give Del Sol a suggestion(but this is not criticism) would be to add some yogurt and peanut butter to the breakfast for additional healthy options and sources of protein.But I can tell you the Del Sol Inn has become my family's permanent home on our visits to Disneyland. I suggest you make it your home to if you want a great value hotel that is very clean, has all the amenities you will need, and is directly across from the park.Hello Jteninty,Thank you so much for your wonderful review. We are so glad to hear that you have such great stays at our hotel. We appreciate all of your feedback and have let the manager know about your breakfast suggestions, and thank you for helping us to improve. We strive to offer the best service to all of our guests. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with other travelers!It is our pleasure to be your home away from home during your visits to Disneyland and look forward to many more years of having you has our guest.

5471,"We stayed at this hotel back in October 2013 and enjoyed it very much.I wish the same could be said for this visit.The rates had climbed a bit for medical rates since our last visit ten months ago, but that's to be expected. What we hadn't expected was that the breakfast was no longer included with the room, and we had to pay 14 a person for it. It is too far for people with disabilities to walk anywhere else to eat, and the shuttle is unreliable at best, so we were stuck with eating breakfast there.The fans still don't work in the washrooms, which is very inconvenient, especially with my son having stomach issues every time we travel due to his health problems.The a/c was much too cold. When we turned it off, it would get too hot, since it's summer. You couldn't reach a balance.We had had issues the last time with waiting for hours for the shuttle to pick us up from the hospital. We had the same issue this time, and I ended up, once again, taking a taxi, so my son, who is very ill, wouldn't have to wait for hours after already having surgical appointments all day. I did talk to the front desk about it, and, to their credit, they comped us dinner, which was nice, and did improve the mood some.We will not be returning to Hilton Garden Inn, especially since five different amounts were coming out of my visa/debit account after returning home, and when calling to inquire about why this had occurred, I was told it was to factor in meals we had charged to the room, although I'm not sure why it would take five different credit/debits to establish that. There was still a discrepancy of 22 CAD that had nothing to do with the exchange rate, and that was not explained adequately to me. Not very satisfied.",handicap,1,llm_validated,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1

Unfortunately, I had pulled my hamstring prior to my arrival and was in extreme pain after walking through 2 airports and pulling my luggage. The hotel staff took me to my room in a wheelchair and brought me ice and other items to assist with my pain. On top of that, they gave me a Get Well card signed by all the staff. The room is nice (not too big and not too small) and the furniture is well appointed. The bathroom is a really great size with the closets located inside the restroom along the wall (nice touch). Before I arrived I read the reviews where other travelers complained about a reflection on the sliding door that separates the living room from the bedroom at night. I did not experience that. I enjoyed the indoor pool/jacuzzi and the close proximity to the Donut Bar (the donuts are splendid), the House of Blues, as well as other restaurants, banks and stores. The street it is located on is more quaint than lively, but you're a stone's throw away from the action. The room service is great ( I ordered breakfast a couple of mornings) as well and the delivery team makes sure you're satisfied. They also have a discount card avail (not sure it's available to all traveler profiles) that you can use at nearby restaurants which was a plus.

8547,My husband was taken seriously ill whilst we were on holiday in Florida (From the UK) and admitted to the Florida Hospital Orlando right next door to this hotel. I stayed for 13 nights and my husband was with me for 9 nights following his surgery. I had no car (My husband did all the driving) so was relieved that there is a free shuttle which runs between the hotel and the hospital and is available upon request. Wendy's was right next to the car park and there is a 7 Eleven petrol station on the corner so I was able to get everything I needed. Having the fridge in the room and micowave was also very useful. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff whether it was getting extra pillows or faxing my insurance documents to the UK. What I needed most was kindness and I certainly got that from everybody we had dealings with. The rooms are a good size and I had a sofa for my husband to sit on and a desk where I could work. The showers are really good and the bath was most useful for my husband. The large King beds are out of this world -the best beds ever! The breakfast is more than adequate and we appreciated coffee being available all the time. Whilst a number of people stay because of the close proximity of the hotel to the hospital this hotel is a happy safe place and we had lots of fun around the pool whilst my husband was recovering.Yes there are no doubt better hotels in Orlando but not at this price and I doubt whether the beds will be any more comfortable.

6747,"I am writing the review at the hotel. Lets just put aside the inconvenience of the location aside at the moment. I chose to stay here inside of the south beach because I want a quiet hotel but guess what, there are plane flying over my head every ten minutes! And guess what, when I called the front desk they told me they have never heard any plane noise. I went down to talk to the manager on duty and he claimed he has never had any complaints and he has been working here for two years. They are treating me as if I made this up. I invited the manager on duty to go to my room to prove that there are planes noise every ten minutes. He heard it himself very inevitably and instead of trying to solve the problem, simply told me that there is nothing he can do about the planes. I told him that I am aware of it but is the other side of the hotel going to be better I asked. Of course he can't answer the questions since he claimed no guests have complained about the noise before...well they must all be deaf. I requested to check the rooms on the other side of the hotel. We went together and it's slightly better, the catch is its facing a main road and there is traffic. I truly dislike how they handle my complaints. Now lets get to some other technical issue. The vents of the air conditioning blows directly to the bed onto my head so I can't turn any air conditioning on. By the way they don't give you adapters, they are part of the minibar item so you need to purchase them. Not to mention that one needs to purchase wifi connection. That is the least of the problems. By the way I asked the manager on duty in light of the noise of planes on the one side and the traffic on the other side of the hotel, which is the lesser of two evils for an insomniac like me. He said it would be the side facing traffic. Oh so he finally heard the plane noise So I didn't make it up after all! Shame on this mandarin oriental. The chain should disown this property to preserve its standard. Do not stay here!Dear Ms. Yao,I am very sorry to read of the noise disturbance you encountered which has also been brought to my attention by our Front Office Manager and our Rooms Division Director, who has tried contacting you.Please understand that Mandarin Oriental, Miami was built with the highest of standards and to withstand category five hurricane force winds.We are an urban city resort, tucked away on a semi private island, away from the traffic noise of downtown and the South Beach festive scene.

Only other disappointment was that our room had only a shower, not a full bath. We are sorry you were disappointed with some aspects of your stay. We strive to make every guest happy and comfortable. We have had a very very busy Spring season and the hotel has been at capacity many days. Unfortunately that has meant that our breakfast area has been a bit crowded some mornings when everyone shows up at the same time. We do provide outdoor seating to alleviate some of the space issues. Our breakfast is pretty extensive with eggs, meat, pancakes, cereals, fruits, breads, etc - so guests may also linger a bit longer than at other less complete breakfasts. Our regular rooms do feature a glass shower with a separate granite vanity area. This design was created due to guest reviews and requests. It seems that most guests prefer a shower and the tub was wasted space. We do have a few handicap access rooms that have tubs, so if you return to the area, please inquire about them.

If you've already committed to spend SF hotel money to stay near attractions, this isn't a bad spend.Pros: location - the Powell St. cable car ends two blocks away from you on the opposite corner of the block of buildings you would be in. Theaters and museums are mere blocks away. Bed - my goodness was this bed comfortable. I don't sleep well on most hotel mattresses, but I did here - which is good because I was here for a week! Wifi - complimentary and pretty good from my room. They have accessible rooms - which oddly enough I got, though I don't need it. Refrigerator in the room! Victory for me. I have medical needs for one, hate shelling out extra, and it is also convenient for keeping fresh fruit and other items cool so I don't have to shell out for the overpriced, less-than-great breakfasts nearby. Individual climate control - it does actually get hot in SF on occasion. The air conditioning did its job.Cons: location - there is a nightclub across the street and these windows don't appear to be double-glazed! They DO have ear plugs in the rooms and I was asked at check in if I needed a street-side or interior room. I was not facing the nightclub, but still got noise when the restaurant downstairs took out the trash at late/early hours. Age. This property IS renovated, but its age shows in spots, like in the wiring that's on the wall instead of behind it and closets that are ridiculously small. Air conditioning is by unit in the window. Some people don't like this (I do). Housekeeping: they didn't seem to want to replace things in the bathroom (i.e. washcloths, not soap) and the toilets are dual flush. Even full flush doesn't... um... always do the job. Ahem. Also, the panhandlers will be waiting for you. Don't head west on some of the nearby streets (esp Eddy). That is the Tenderloin. If you are looking for what the Tenderloin has to offer, well, then go ahead.The list of cons is longer, but I find fault easily - take it for what its worth. There is a popular restaurant attached to the hotel. I did not eat there (spendy), but it attracted a solid crowd in a neighborhood with a lot of competition.

When we entered the hotel lobby there were a ton of people either waiting for rooms or trying to check in. It seemed there was no organization at all.I am an SPG member and booked one king room on points and booked a 2 bedroom suite at full rate. At the desk, I was not greeted as an SPG member. I was told our rooms would not be available until 3pm. It was about 10am. I complained a bit and was told the hotel was fully booked the night before and there is nothing available. My group and I decided to book a tour of Seattle to pass the next few hours.We arrived back at the hotel at 3pm and found only one room available. Needless to say, this did not sit well with my group. We were all very tired and just wanted to get to our room to relax. About 45 minutes later, a room was found for us and we were told to head up...except and the other desk attendant said No, that room is set for another person. The woman helping us said that the room in question should not have been given to another party. Now we are mad. Finally the woman helping me found yet another room. I told my party our initial room was given away and that second desk attendant chimed in with no it wasn't. Those other people have been waiting since 7 am! Once we finally received the room key we grabbed our luggage and tried to get on the elevator. What a mess that was! There was a group of folks with a luggage cart filled to the brim trying to maneuver it onto the elevator. It was too heavy for the elevator so they were stuck half in and half out blocking up the hallway! Finally we got through and went up to our room.Our room was the 2 bedroom king suite. It was a nice room. Unfortunately there was a big iron mark in the rug but it was clean. There are no phones in the bedrooms. Only one phone on the desk in the living room. The room was spacious and comfortable. There is only one bathroom. It has 2 doors, one opens to the main living area and the other opens to a bedroom. One problem in the bedroom was the door stop for the bathroom door is right by the bed where you step when getting out of bed! That is a design flaw that really should be corrected! The bath was large and clean.As usual in the Sheraton chain, the bedding is fantastic! Overall, the room was great for what we needed. It slept the three of us comfortably. The location is good to the Space Needle. The area is a bit rundown but there are some places to eat, which we did not do. I would stay here again if they work out the delays in check in. In the meantime, if you are staying here, I suggest you request a guaranteed early check in time to avoid the hassles we endured. I did explain all of these concerns on my SPG emailed survey and was pleasantly surprised to be contacted by the hotel manager via email. He apologized for the circumstances and said the hotel is working on the influx of cruise passengers and trying to figure out its policies for check in times. His prompt response was unexpected and completely appreciated! I was also issued some SPG points as compensation. Because of his attention I do not hesitate to recommend this property. It is a fair price in a good location with fantastic beds!",handicap,0,llm_validated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
4753,"We arrived October 26, 2018. We used the hotel's underground parking garage. Bryan, a hotel empolyee who opened the parking garage security gate, assisted us with parking our car by directing my husband into a parking spot. While Bryan, stood behind our car, he directed my husband into backing into a very tight parking space. Bryan continued to direct my husband while he backed into the space until Bryan said you are on the wall! When my husband pulled forward we saw massive areas of paint had been scraped off our car. NOT once did Bryan indicate the car was about to hit the wall. Bryan never apologized. We told Michael,who was working at the front desk, about the incident. But because we had friends waiting on us for dinner we did not fill out an Incident Report at that time. When we returned later that night we spoke to Ruby ( who was working at the front desk) about the incident and she advised us that we needed to talk to Candice Hudson, GM, who would be in the next morning betweem 9-10AM. We were then given a Wyndham Garden Incident Report form. The next morning we went to talk to Ms. Hudson only to be told she would not be in. But we did ask to see the security video tape of the incident which an empolyee showed us. We then asked who could we talk to about an incident report with and we were told Ms. Elysia Smith, manager on duty. When we had the opportunity to speak with Ms. Elysia Smith her immediate response: was since my husband was driving the vehicle then the hotel had no liability even though her empolyee directed my husband into the space. I asked for a copy of the incident report we had completed and was told by Ms. Elysia Smith we could not have one (as copies are prohibited). An empolyee suggested we take a picture of the report and Ms. Smith immediatley chastised him for his suggestion. WE are extremely disappointed the way the accident was handled. If Wynndham wants hard line, no empathy, and rude general managers then Ms. Smith is a perfect fit. As of October 26-27, 2018 there is no signage in the garage to direct traffic to exit. The concrete columns in the garage are huge and straddle two parking spaces. According to Bryan, the coulmns are wrapped to prevent cars from scrapping them--so the hotel must expect all the columns to be hit. Our hotel room was spacious as it was a handicapp accessible room and the beds were comfortable. The interior of the hotel is beautiful and spacious. Good location for walking to Canal Street and the Quarter. But with management's attidude toward us, our visit was not pleasureable and we will not stay there again.Thank you for taking the time to write a review on your most recent stay with us.

8701,"My wife had a 4 year old child in Scottish Rite's ICU following a palette repair surgery. This hotel is in very close proximity to the hospital. We walked into the hotel around 10:30pm after a long day of surgery. We were met by a wonderful staff that had our room keys ready, 2 bottles of water, and we didn't have to fill anything out. We were in our rooms within a few minutes of pulling in the parking lot. The hotel was very clean and we were always met by friendly staff members as we came and went over the 2 days we were in the hotel.Dear CP171717,Thank you for staying with us at the Hampton Inn Atlanta Perimeter Center. We appreciate your time and comments concerning your recent stay with us. We are happy to know that our location worked out for you and your family.

2940,"Over the years I have stayed at numerous Hamptons and been generally satisfied, but not now.We stayed at this Hampton for two nights. Somehow we got into a handicap room. The room was sparsely furnished with only one desk style chair no place to put a suitcase and hooks behind a curtain for a closet. The first issue was the heater which we set at 69 degrees. We went to bed early and at 11 PM woke up sweating to a temp of 84 degrees. Obviously the thermostat did not work. The handicap shower has a vertical slide to hold the shower head but it would not stay at the top nor would the sprayer stay vertical it would flop down. The real issue was a total lack of housekeeping when we returned on the second day. A coffee cup with an inch of coffee was still on the nightstand along with the ice bucket full of water and the bag half in the bucket. I had left it in front of the TV with the lid off so they could see it but they did not move it. In the bathroom there was a little powder on the floor from the morning which was still there, obviously they did not sweep or mop the floor. But the coup de grace was the toilet paper floating in the toilet. That was disgusting, they never touched the toilet to clean or someone used it while we were gone. Overall the hotel was noisy with trains going by during the night an you could hear voices from the lobby. The breakfast was mediocre with a small breakfast area. Look for a better place to stay then here. When I mentioned the issues to the desk clerk she took my number and said the manager would call. Now 72 hours later no call, what does that tell youThank you so much for taking the time to tell us about your recent experience at our hotel.

Many out of towners like myself, who are having surgery stay here, including the rich and famous. I had expected convenience but there was so much more. First, the food is remarkably good and the service was good as well. But what sets this place apart is the staff they are incredibly helpful to and supportive of the patients are are there for anything you need. So if you are coming to Chicago for surgery or other medical care, stay here!Thank you so much for your feedback! We are glad you enjoyed your stay and the food in our dining outlet.

9651,"Was booked here for work. The place was half decent, beds were uncomfortable. And the the walls have horrible sound proofing. The water was really hot (good thing) and lasted a long time. The guy at the front dest was really weird, and made check-in a 20min process (we had already prepaid). The parking in the garage underneath was really small space with a bunch of support poles everywhere (hard to reverse) and maneuver around. But good location right downtown and cheap. My co-workers room had a balcony, and the door didn't lock, when the wind blew, it opened. She wanted to move to a different room, and the guy at the front desk asked her to put a chair in front of it to solve the problem. She moved to a different room after 15min of arguing with the man at the front desk and after he went to the room with us to verify. Then he asked her to clean the room and then he would move her.",handicap,0,llm_validated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

Everyone was so nice..I have a broken wrist and staff assisted me all of the way with a cheery attitude and smiles (most important because I was a waitress for 30 years and I know all about customer service). I saw other people write that it was a bit noisy. I did not find that to be the case at all. I enjoyed the festive atmosphere even though I was in my room. I LOVED SCOOTER, MY FRIEND THE FISH!!!!!Anyway I HIGHLY suggest The Pearl as a place to stay. They all made me feel like family and I will definitely return on my next visit!Thank you to all staff, from managers to housekeepers!Lorie RoppHappy Holidays.

6037,This had to be one of the poorest experiences I've had at a JW. The front desk staff made little effort to rectify their errors despite me booking this room well in advance. I was put in a handicap room with no attempts to recover the situation. I would take my money and go somewhere else next timeThank you for your recent visit. I want to personally apologize for your disappointment. Please know that I have personally followed up with our front office team as a learning to see how we could have made your experience more positive.

2229,"We stayed at this property in advance of a week long trip with an 0700 flight time. Since we live 40 miles out, we decided to stay in town instead of driving in for our flight that morning. Our stay on the way out was lovely. We enjoyed a great meal in the bar, watched some of the Olympics and chatted with another guest who was in town covering the Arlington Million. Our room was lovely and we took a nightcap back to watch the planes fly over (every 2 minutes) and enjoy the sounds of the families at the pool. The fact that all of this was on the completely non-smoking property, it was a lovely evening. Our shuttle driver was promptly on site at 0530 to leave for the airport. But, of course, there was one guest who couldn't manage to be on time. While we arrived at the prescribed 10 minutes prior and others arrived in advance of the van arriving, the front desk called due to one, single guest who couldn't get his act together. Because they were so overly accommodating to him, I was completely blown away by the shuttle trip upon our return.We arrived at the airport, got our luggage and called the hotel. They informed us to go to door 2 at the shuttle center. We proceeded there - it is about a 7 minute walk for tired, suitcase lugging travelers. We arrived at the assigned door at 2316. With a number of vans there, we were trying to see what each of them were when we saw a Marriott van pull away and drive off - EMPTY. So, I called the hotel to ask whether their driver had just driven away even though we had called and he should have been alerted that there were travelers arriving. I was told that the van runs every half hour and that the next one would be at 2330. I inquired whether this meant that the van would be ON THE WAY or was expected to ARRIVE at that time. I never really got a clear answer. When a van finally arrived on the property at 2352, I started to understand WHY I wasn't given a clear answer. While we waited 36 minutes for a van, some others told us they had been waiting over an hour. Additionally, they stated they had called the hotel and been told that THEY missed the VAN. I am not sure how it is possible for the guest to MISS THE VAN - surely the driver has some responsibility for getting out and announcing himself when they are parked (stacked) in 2 lanes of traffic.Then, upon our arrival at the hotel, I used my parking ticket as instructed to leave the parking lot without paying the daily fees only to get an error message that my ticket was invalid and my fee due was 241.00. I tried 3 times and then started to go back to a parking space to walk back to the hotel and wait while the 40 people on the van got checked in to their rooms to get a valid ticket to get my car out of the lot when our friend noted that another gate was open for an event that was concluding. We pulled through it and left. I fly out of O'Hare on average 12 - 15 times per year for business and pleasure. I use park sleep fly once or twice a year. And I am an active Marriott member. I thought that I had found a new favorite but this experience leaves me irritated a day later. When I park at the airport, I can be off the property and on the road in a half hour. Last night, with a flight arrival time of 2230, we were finally on the highway at 0020. This is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. Needless to say, I will be calling the GM at the hotel and possibly corporate later this week.Good Morning DLogsdon,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. I apologize about the experience you had with the airport shuttles during your stay. I will make sure to share your comments with the appropriate staff. It is hard to say what exactly occurred during the time you were waiting for our shuttle at the airport and various things such as traffic, as well as trying to accommodate all of our guest could effect the exact time of arrival at the airport. We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you,",handicap,0,llm_validated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
9583,"This was a great property, off the traditional Disney-beaten path, but a great find for a great price. My mom and I visit the area frequently and have tried many hotels in the Disney vicinity, both on and off site. We search around for best rates, and this location was one of the least expensive in the Lake Buena Vista area during the weekend we were there. It was clean, well-decorated, and lovely. The main dining area for breakfast was very clean and the staff was quite friendly. The beds were amazing they were the most comfortable I've experience in a hotel in quite awhile. The only minor issue (which isn't really on at all) was that in the room we stayed in, the sink was in the bathroom, so my mom and I needed to wait on one another to use the sink facilities. However, it was a handicap accessible room designed to accommodate wheelchairs, so this may not be the set-up of all the rooms. The room itself was quite large and we had more than enough space for our comfort. We could have through a few extra people in the room and still have been just fine. Very clean, very modern, very well-kept. This location will go into our standard rotation for the Orlando area. Well done!",handicap,0,agreed,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
2786,"We stayed here for two nights. The only reason we booked here was for the parking as we were on a roadtrip. For some reason one of the car parks was shut (think they were decorating) There were only 2 disabled spaces left so we went and asked where to park. The guy at the front desk was very unhelpful, but told us to park in the shaded area in a tight corner. We did as we were told, but felt uneasy about this. The next day 2 cars had completely blocked us in, good job we weren't needing the car until the next day. Thank goodness that the other car park appeared to open that day as we were no longer blocked in. Check-in was OK- the guy seemed disinterested and had no customer service skills whatsoever. He obviously did not want to be there. Not a good start to our San Fan.Our room was OK- dated but relatively clean and comfortable. The location was good right on Lombard street and 10 minutes walk from Fishermans wharf. Was good that we could have coffee or orange juice and some pastries in the foyer for breakfast. Very basic but did the job. We had an OK stay in the end, but they could make the hotel so much better with some improvements and if they hired staff who actually care then that would make the experience so much better for us!",handicap,0,llm_validated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
2923,"I spent two nights here on what was a VERY busy weekend, due, I imagine, to any number of colleges ending their spring semesters. The hotel was jammed with visitors and because I arrived late in the day, I got what must have been the last room, even though I had had a reservation for several weeks. I was put in a handicap-access room on the first floor, which was spacious and seemed quiet due to its location at the end of the hall. However, at 7:45 am the construction crew started working in the room directly over my head and I was awakened by the sound of someone scraping the floor above my bed. So much for sleeping in for a late work day ahead...I complained by phone to the front desk and they apologized and promised to move me for the second night of my stay. Two hours later I checked in at the desk to see if I could move before I had to leave for work, but was told that the hotel was again booked solid and they would see what could be done. At that point, I got angry and mentioned that I had requested the change hours before, I am a Hilton Honors member, and anything else that I could think of that would persuade the agent to make the change. She did point out that the renovation work was posted on their website, and there was a printed apology in the lobby, neither of which made me any less sleepy...She finally found a room on the third floor, which was above the floor being worked on, and I moved. It was a nicer room. HOWEVER, bright and early the next morning (Sunday) the sounds of a power nailer wafted up through the vent in the bathroom. Luckily, I had to be at work early that day anyway, so I was already up. If you are booked here, try to get as far from any renovation construction as possible. Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are very sorry that you werent happy with your guestroom during your recent trip.

7223,"When we order something special for a loved ones birthday apart from the value there are always sentiments attached to it.  My sister aspires to start her own bakery and holds Labonel Fine Baking in high regard. Keeping this in minds we thought a Labonel cake will make her birthday more special.  We ordered the cake 1 week in advance and had confirmed the order the previous day. We also spoke to them the very same day we were supposed to pick up the cake. Both the times we were informed by their staff that the store is open on 23rd Sept. till 6pm (this is after you ignore the fact that their official timing is 7pm).  They decide to call me on the day of pickup at 4:50pm to inform me that they will shut down at 5:30pm. So, not only was i expected to drop whatever i was doing at a moment's notice i believe they expected me to teleport to their store.  Well since the cake held sentimental value for me I did leave immediately and rushed to the Gachibowli store. I made it there by 5:10pm and can you imagine my dismay when I saw that the store was closed! To add to it no one answered the phone. I stood there for 30 minutes trying to get in touch with them on multiple phone numbers on the website but there was no response.  I could not believe that a renown place could be this unprofessional. If they cannot value their customers and have no regard for others time and sentiments I do not think it would ever matter how their product is.  My sister no longer considers them a role model as she values her customers more than having a fancy store with expensive products.  Since they did not contact me back even the next day I feel the only option left then is to complain on social media and hence this post. I hope this falls on deaf ears of Labonel owners.  I know I will not be repeating the mistake of ordering something from this place and to anyone who reads this, you have been warned :)  Update: I have a facebook post which certifies that minimum 5 friends of mine have dealt with similar bad experiences.",handicap,0,llm_validated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
