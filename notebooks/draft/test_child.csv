10,My husband and I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco with our 18 month son. We had a great experience. The whole staff was wonderful from the shuttle driver to the desk staff. We had the shuttle pick us up from the airport and they were pretty prompt. The staff had a crib set up in our room within 10 minutes of our arrival. Everyone was extremely friendly to our son which I was grateful for. We did experience the warm temperatures in the hallway but the lobby temperature was pleasent. On the 3rd night of our stay our AC broke in our room (and there was a loud party in the room next to ours). We called the front desk and they switched rooms for us pretty quickly. They even gave my son some toys to play with while we packed and did the swap. The location is amazing. Great restaurants around and plently of places to walk to. The hotel is not within comfortable walking distance to the metro but there is a free trolley that runs from the waterfront to the metro every 15 minutes. The trolley picks up a block from the hotel and runs from 10 to 10.

The front desk clerk, Mary, was very polite and helpful both on the phone when I made reservations as well as in person. It appears this facility may no longer be affiliated with Day's Inn. It's now listed as Englewood Inn Suites. I have to admit I was a little nervous about booking there from the previous reviews. Something must have changed since the last negative one in Oct of last year. While Englewood Inn Suites is still not a five star hotel it is a nice place to rest your head. Rooms were a nice size, very clean with updated furnishings. Plenty of towels and toiletries. The only complaint I had is that the beds were a little on the small side. We had 2 double beds in our room. But that wasn't really that big of a deal. The hotel has a pool. My daughter and I enjoyed that both days we were there.

83,"The location of Kona Reef is excellent. You can walk to many great restaurants and bars. They have a beautiful pool and jacuzzi and a great outdoor BBQ cooking area (They cleaned the gas grills every morning). The sunset views from both our lanai and the pool area were spectacular. The room itself was O.K., a little dated, small but functional. We had two adults and two kids, but there was enough room for all. The bathroom and kitchen was well equipped, nothing fancy but adequate. There was always plenty of parking close to the room. The only real negative for me was the occasional slamming of doors from all the units. The inner walkways amplified any voices or footsteps. The noise of guests coming and going could get a little loud in the morning. Overall a great place for a family to stay.",34361,location kona reef is excellent you walk many great restaurants bars they have beautiful pool jacuzzi great outdoor bbq cooking area they cleaned gas grills every morning sunset views lanai pool area were spectacular room was k little dated small functional we had two adults two kids was enough room bathroom kitchen was well equipped nothing fancy adequate was always plenty parking close room real negative was occasional slamming doors units inner walkways amplified voices footsteps noise guests coming going could get little loud morning overall great place family stay,"kids, family",child

Everything worked fine. Everything was decently clean and comfortable. My only complaint was a few of the housekeepers were very rude and acted annoyed if we were still in our room when them came to clean and asked to come a bit later. As well as a few of the mornings when we went to enjoy the free breakfast, some housekeepers sat and watched what we did and what we ate and how much we took. I was even told that I took ""too many plates"" when I actually needed them since I was bringing food back for my daughter and fiancï¿½ï¿½e. And while we ate I was stared at and talked about. Another quick thing was they don't have any working cribs for guests who need them which definitely caused issues when it came to sleeping at night.

As it turned out, our schedule didn't allow him to even use the pool. The property also has lovely grounds with landscaping and fountains, and was in a nice neighborhood for me to take a walk. It is an older property, though, which means noisy elevators, small bathrooms, thin walls, etc. Redocorating doesn't change any of that. We had the wheelchair accessible room with a roll in shower that worked well for my son. There was enough space in the room to include a small refrigerator and microwave but they didn't.

120,"The last time my wife stayed in the area was about 2 years ago and we'd stayed at a different motor lodge a couple miles up the road on route 28. This time we were traveling with our one-year-old child and the last place wasn't the nicest so I decided to spend a little more money to try to get something a little nicer. Wrong. It's an old fashioned drive-up motor lodge. Our room smelled so strongly of bleach when we arrived, I wondered what that smell was covering up. I had a partial answer soon after when I opened the curtains to discover a pair of dirty mens underwear on the floor behind them. The sliding glass door didn't lock other than a big wooden stick which didn't leave me with a lasting sense of security. Speaking of security, none of the keys worked right. The key to open the door to the hallway and the room both required a considerable amount of jiggling to free the lock. I feel badly for anyone stayed near the outside door as it slammed behind with huge BOOM. The TV was one of the old-school standard def models from 20 years ago and was pretty representative the place in general. It was probably last renovated many years ago and it's very tired now. They installed a drop ceiling in the bathroom and for some reason the tub was about a foot off the ground which left my head about an inch from the ceiling. The mattress was old and was about as luxurious as sleeping on a park bench. If you stayed here and loved it, great.
