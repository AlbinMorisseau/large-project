3,The room was clean. But the problem I had was I specifically asked for a room on the first floor because I use a walker and there are no elevators. Upon arrival all they had was 2nd floor. Thanks to my daughter I managed. But if she wasn't there it would have been a big prob! The area it was in was a little shady. Our room was right by the stairs.

10,"This hotel has a large beautiful pool, which is the reason I booked it. My son is recovering from surgery and some of his therapy is done in a swimming pool. As it turned out, our schedule didn't allow him to even use the pool. The property also has lovely grounds with landscaping and fountains, and was in a nice neighborhood for me to take a walk. It is an older property, though, which means noisy elevators, small bathrooms, thin walls, etc. Redocorating doesn't change any of that. We had the wheelchair accessible room with a roll in shower that worked well for my son. There was enough space in the room to include a small refrigerator and microwave but they didn't. I guess they want you to order from room service, but that closes at 9:00 pm.

17,"I am the disabled victim of a drunk driver. For 5 years now, I have been on very heavy doses of narcotic pain medication, and will be for life. It is very dangerous living alone, and I won't tolerate another human living with me. So, I have a specially trained dog trained as an alert dog to watch me and make my life safe to live. Last month, we (my dog, Dana and I) went to Ft Lauderdale, and we stayed at the Ocean breeze motel. We had a wonderful stay. The motel doesn't allow regular p...view moreets, which is one of the reasons we chose it. Less to possibly distract Dana. Beyond that, the rates were low enough for a lower income (the drunk was uninsured) disabled man and his K9 assistant. The owners treated us wonderfully, as they treat their property. What a great place to spend a week in paradise. After the grueling Chicago winter we have suffered (08-09), this motel felt like our home away from home, and we would definitely choose them if we ever would go to Ft Lauderdale again.

The heating/cooling unit on the wall had mold growing in it. I only discovered this when I flipped the vent upward to change the direction of the air. I opted to sleep with the window open instead. Would really recommend that they thoroughly clean those vents. Also despite traveling with a service animal (I'm hearing impaired) and clearly stating that in my reservation, I was put into one of the rooms at the end of the hallway that are designated for those with pets. A neighbor had a dog that would stop barking and my dog, who alerts me when someone is at the door, spent much of the night alerting me to the sound of the side door (next to our room) opening and closing. Incredibly annoying and I didn't get much sleep at all between that and the sound of the highway from needing to keep the windows open.
