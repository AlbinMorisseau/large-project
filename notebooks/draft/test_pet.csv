1,"The hotel was very mediocre - even less than what you would expect from a Super 8. Also, upon check-in, they assessed me an extra 15.00 fee for my dog even though that fee was not disclosed on Hotels.com or the Super 8 hotel interconnect on Policies that is part of the Hotels.com website. Thus the hotel stay turned out to be an 80. a night deal which is more than the amount a rational person would want to pay to stay at a Super 8.",920,hotel was mediocre even less you would expect super eight also upon check they assessed extra fifteen zero fee dog even though fee was not disclosed hotels com super eight hotel interconnect policies is part hotels com website thus hotel stay turned eighty night deal is amount rational person would want pay stay super eight,dog,pet

And the hotel is very conveniently located. But if we'd known that this place was going to be overrun with dogs, we'd have booked in somewhere else, like the sister property Lorien (where we've enjoyed staying before). You really should highlight to potential guests that dogs and cats are allowed at this property, so those of us who have allergies or just don't enjoy having animals up close and personal can have advance notice of the situation here.

18,"This hotel is one that allows pets. We were not sure what we would find when we checked in. When you are traveling on a budget with a pet sometimes the accommodations can be way overpriced and very disappointing. Some places charge a ridiculous rate for pets and are not really that pet friendly. The pet fee at this hotel was only 25. Though the hotel was older (and a bit worn) it was clean and the staff extremely friendly and kind to our little Bella. She had a fine time going out for her walks, the area was safe to walk her (even at night) and away from traffic and she was always greeted with a Hello Bella from the staff when she returned. It was disappointing that the new ice maker had not yet been delivered (installation was over due - not the hotels fault certainly) and the staff apologized for the lack of an ice maker. Luckily the weather was not extremely hot. A small refrigerator in the room would have been nice. Belgin waffle at breakfast was quite good, much better than expected for a do-it-yourself waffle. This place was convenient to highway exit, gas stations, restaurants and stores nearby, least expensive price in the area after summer season rates started. It was clean, very safe, very quiet and we felt welcome.
