1197,"We’ll be in Quito for 2 nights before heading home next week and would like to stay in the Historic District in a nice hotel. I’ve been scouring the typical search sites (booking.com, kayak, Trivago, etc) and oddly none of them seem to have the filter (that I know I’ve seen/used before) present for “elevator” when searching Quito. Definitely in need of some 1st hand intel. Anywho… I am in a wheelchair and although we can manage a flight of steps here or there, being that it’s at the end of our trip, it would be great to find somewhere with an elevator or ground floor rooms (and little to no other steps necessary to get into/around the building).

In the past, I have bought 3 airline seats in order to lay down on certain routes, mainly Southwest, but wondering if anyone has advice here.

1715,"The New Premier Caribbean Hotel for Wheelchair Accessible Travelers has now opened in St. Maarten The Morgan Resort & Spa - St Maarten Luxury ResortMy husband and I were lucky enough to get to be the very first wheelchair guests at the new Morgan Hotel this past May and we were in love at first sight. From the moment you arrive at the property you know you have arrived somewhere very special as you pass through two sets of gates and guard houses before reaching the glamorous front of the hotel; where the amazingly friendly valet/door-people will help you out of your vehicle. Whether it’s helping to assemble back your manual wheelchair or safely unloading a power wheelchair, the staff was obviously trained well as to how to best assist us wheeled travelers. (They will even help carry every last piece of equipment you may have traveled with; and we brought a lot)As you enter the glamorous but modestly sized lobby, you can’t help but take your eyes off of the giant, gorgeous infinity pool overlooking the ocean that’s just on the other side of the lobby(*Will come back to the pool in a sec). The amazing front desk staff and concierge will not only help you get checked in, but will personally escort you to your room to help orient you with the hotel amenities and make sure you have everything you need while settling in (ask for Arielle; she’s phenomenal). After taking some time to explore the giant accessible room and attached living room, I noticed how they remembered all the little details that are most important to us accessible travelers: lowered closets, electrical controls all within reach, access to the entire room; accessible bathroom with roll under sink, safety toilet (with good amount of grab bars), roll-in shower (flip down benches on order to replace shower chairs); handheld+waterfall shower heads; as well as having the coffee machine, safe and fridge within reachable zone.Honestly I was blown away by how much they got right with the room; especially after staying at some insane nightmare hotels in the caribbean that claimed to be accessible prior to booking the room. Whoever designed this hotel really took the time to plan out what was needed for their 9 (yes I said 9) accessible rooms and oceanfront suites. What impressed me even more, was the General Manager (Saul) took the time to sit down with us to get some feedback about how we were finding the accessible features of the hotel; and took the time to walk around the property and room with us and his builder to see what else could be improved on as they were finishing up the property. (Which was not much at all. Just some little stuff like a lower peep hole for the door, changing the bathroom door handle to add a few inches of entry area and changing from shower seats to benches for safety).Just like many hotels where we try to give some critical feedback on the accessibility of the property, they could have just humored us and pretended to care; but no, not these folks. They truly seem to be concerned about making the changes ASAP so that ALL guests get the chance to enjoy their property equally. That’s not something you find often in any hotel; let alone a hotel in the Carribean. They even are ordering some beach wheelchairs to use for the pool and maybe even the neighboring beaches. (They can even rent you a beach wheelchair from a local company to be able to take to the other beaches on the island who will bring the chair right to you at that beach and come back at the end of the day for it).Now speaking of their fabulous pool. Never in my life have I seen such a large pool with zero-degree entry going around the entire sides of this football field sized pool. (There is a regular entry point of the pool too if that’s easier). You’ll never want to get out of this pool and you probably won’t need to since the fantastic pool staff bring you anything you need and the bar in the water will fulfill all your cocktail and food fantasies. What I loved was the fact they had these soft pool chairs surrounding the pool (1’ away) that I could easily pull myself out of the water and right into the chair from. The only negative I will say about any of this is the fact that they put the hot tub in the middle of the pool with no other entry point and you have to go up stairs and down stairs to switch bodies of water. There also is a really cool swim in a cave in the corner with a built in waterslide; but no way to get to the top of the slide if your legs don’t work (not that my spine Dr. would appreciate me trying slides…lol).If you can drag yourself away from the pool, you must try the restaurant and bar. Chef David will BLOW YOUR MIND with his food. He hit it out of the park on his first try with the opening menu for the hotel. My spouse couldn’t stop raving about the Lobster and the Seafood Paella and I was obsessed with the vegetarian items on the menu; especially the Empanadas (They even serve an Impossible burger; which is so hard to find in St. Maarten). Every single thing we tried for breakfast was delicious and will fill you up well for your busy day on the island. Try the fruit and bread platter if you can or the pancakes will have you licking the plate. Or if you don;t feel like dining, try out the bar and let the Bartender Nigel make you one of his enticing cocktails (let alone he’s the nicest guy to talk to on the island).I wish I could list every single person who went out of their way to take care of our every need at the hotel; but it would add an entire page to this review. Let’s just say I can’t say one negative thing about any of the employees at the hotel. They all made us feel so welcome and treated us as if we were visiting their own home. Leaving was the most difficult part of our entire visit at the hotel. We spent two life changing weeks at the Morgan and tried out every aspect of that resort and they passed every test we threw at them. There are very few hotels I have ever fallen in love with, but this one definitely moved into my heart for life and I can’t wait to return. (Or move to the island… that is how much they made us fall in love with St. Maarten here) Please trust me, you won’t be disappointed and you’ve never enjoyed yourself more on vacation till you stay here. (You don’t even have to have a wheelchair to have as good of a time as us).",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

670,"Hello and good afternoon! My name is Karen and I am a 59 year old plus sized woman (currently 305 lbs coming down from originally being 430 lbs). I currently own a Pride Victory 10 mobility scooter because at the time I got it (5 years ago) that was the only mobility scooter Medicare would cover (at 80%) for a person weighing over 430 pounds. I would be very grateful on any advice/opinions any of you have on folding wheelchairs. Being as I have had my mobility scooter for quite a few years now, it is time to get something new again. Do I get another scooter, do I get a power wheelchair, or do I get one of those plus a folding wheelchair??? All decisions I need to make and would sure appreciate your input. I do not own and cannot afford to buy a vehicle with a lift (on SSDI with very limited income), so I got ADA certified and ride a paratransit bus that has a lift here in Phoenix, Az to my doctors appointments, pharmacy, etc….The problem is I have no social life, or way to go out to do anything fun like out to dinner with friends, going to a mall, craft fairs, visit friends houses etc because paratransit will not take me to anywhere other than medically related places. I did not know about folding wheelchairs until just recently. It folds up, I can put it in the trunk of a friends vehicle, put it in the trunk of a Uber…..I could actually go places and do things again!! Plus just on a side note in case this helps someone else decide on a scooter…my Pride Victory 10 has been wonderful, very relaible, never a problem. However it is big, wide, heavy even broken down into pieces, and longer than most other scooters because it is a bariatric sized scooter as well. It for sure causes issues at times because of the turning radius, space in restaurants, it’s longer than most street vans with ramps up the back can usually fit. Allll of that being said (whew!!) what do you all think of FOLDING wheelchairs? It would still have to be for a plus sized me, so I would need a weight capacity over 305 lbs. Are they comfortable, relaible, can I even lift one by myself or would I need constant help to be able to use it by myself? Brand names you recommend and why?? Sorry for the book, I just wanted to tell you as much as I could so you could know what I would need better maybe??? Any information or suggestions would be very much appreciated.

We visited the Waco Mammoth National Monument & all the trails & the dig site were easy for me to navigate. Pretty exciting to see actual mammoth bones! We went to Cameron Park & there were many trails for my scooter & my husband’s bike. The bridge over the Brazos River was scooter friendly, too. We spent a couple days in Austin after leaving Waco. We stayed at the Lakeway Resort & Spa on Travis Lake. The room had a lovely view of the Lake & we even saw a doe & 2 fawns in the wilderness below our balcony. The bathroom was spacious & had a low tub with plenty of grab bars & a slide bar for the shower head. The only problem was that the bed was extra high, so somewhat difficult to get up onto. Lots of wide open spaces & a beautiful place. Visited Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center. The trails were either cemented or pea gravel. Lots of shady spots to get out of the sun if needed. The gift shop was large & spacious, plenty of room for scooter to navigate. Also hit the Roy & Ann Butler Hike & Bike Trail, a waterfront trail loop around Lady Bird Lake. It was also pavement & pea gravel all around. Hope this helps anyone with TX tourist ideas!💙",pet handicap,1,1,0,0,0,0,disputed

We have recently “graduated” from Hoyer lift to slide board transfers wheelchair ←> bed, and that makes finding a hotel easier. It was a wonderful trip with no “surprises”. Hotel: Fairfield Inn at Marriott. ADA room with 2 queens. I called the hotel directly 2 days before arrival and Jaz at the front desk was very helpful. She measured top of bed height (24”) which made for a pretty level transfer. I explained that getting out of bed would require backing the wheelchair up to the headboard, so any nightstand must be movable. The left-hand bed did not have a nightstand on the left so that worked. I also asked for bathroom grab bars to be on the right, and she double checked that our room had that config. When we arrived, everything was as specified. My husband and I did not need assistance, but I saw our check-in person Mallory helping a couple with mobility issues load their bags on a dolly. Free breakfast was a better than average self-serve. I served my husband, but there was staff refilling food and I bet they would help someone if asked. Activities: Harbor-walk: beautiful, wide 1.5 mile walkway along the water. Made of large concrete sidewalk slabs and the transitions, while pretty good, were still painful for my husband. Whaling museum: A great museum. You could spend a whole day there. Roomy elevators to all floors, even the observation deck. The only thing inaccessible is climbing into the whaling ship model. I took the highlights tour (even though my husband chose not to) and it was also accessible. Fort Tabor: Lots of paved paths around the fort and by the water. Totally smooth sailing. Walking: Historic center roads are cobblestones, uncomfortable even in a car. Sidewalks are slate, which wasn’t too bad, and crosswalks are slate. I managed to find street or lot parking everywhere. I took a guided whaling themed walking tour for an hour while my husband sat on the whaling museum patio, but the walk covered just one city block and we did not enter buildings, so it would have been possible in a wheelchair. Restaurants:All were accessible and people went out of their way to be helpful. Antonio’s: They put out a ramp so the wheelchair could climb the one step to get in. There was room to navigate to a table. Tia Maria’s: We ate outdoors at a table. We loved the food and went twice. Lots of authentic Portuguese faire. Indoors would not be accessible. Black Whale: Large parking lot, easy ramp, lots of roomy table choices. Coastal Bubbles Wine Bar: On my walk I saw a lovely deck with the sign “Sip, slurp, Sundays. Oysters $2”. The deck was up a flight of stairs, but the manager showed me that entering at the back of the restaurant was street level. Best oysters of the summer. Lovely fall weather and a great trip.

15,"I’m just back from a three week, six country vacation in Europe. As a person with a spinal cord injury who cannot stand/walk, the past 35 years of air travel has been extremely frustrating and sometimes physically painful. I always come home saying I never want to stop traveling, but I wish, just once, the air travel would go smoothly. Well this time was oh so close! Nearly as perfect as it could get. I fly United out of O’Hare a number of times per year. In comparing O’Hare against most of the European airports I’ve been through, it has always provided the least attention to me as a wheelchair user. This time, something was different. More special treatment, a specific line at customs, and better trained personnel from the agents to the lift assistants. What, Finally?? It would have been an absolutely mind blowing experience had my chair been at the plane door when I arrived back in Chicago. The agent said I’d have to go to baggage claim to get it. Knowing my rights, I said my chair must be delivered to the door. (Ok, technically “as close to the door as possible”). Funny, within literally seconds, my chair appeared. What? OK. That was it. The attendant wheeled me through the wheelchair line at customs and we were out the door. Just wanted to share. Hope this is the start of a trend. 🤞 For the trip we flew into Amsterdam and out of Zurich. I splurged and hired a driver for the Netherlands and Belgium where we attended the Fomula 1 Dutch Grand Prix practice day and visited a few WWI & II memorial sites. I set up the hotels and sites on my own for this part of the trip. Then we made our way to France where we met some friends and hired the Claire & George Foundation (C&G)based in Bern Switzerland to drive us through Luxembourg, Germany, and Switzerland. C&G provided a driver, set up all accessible hotels, and any attraction and event tickets for us They even arranged a hoyer lift for me to be delivered to our hotels It was a wonderful, stress-free trip that included the Mosel Wine festival and a Champaign region tour I highly recommend C&G. They are easy to work with and can help plan the type of travel you like. Last year they set up a mostly train tour of Switzerland for us. After all the years of setting up my own travel, it was nice to have someone else do the work. Now, if they could only take care of those cobblestones… Happy to share locations and hotels. Just ask. ~Wendy",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

1444,Anyone here who flies frequently notice an increase in the number of passengers who are taking advantage the pre-board option? Especially on Southwest?I use wheelchair full time and always need to preboarder and use a aisle chair. If I am flying Southwest I can transfer directly from my chair to a seat in the front rows but only if they are not already occupied. The gate agents are always really good about getting me on first but there is always a line of at least ten other “disabled” people jockeying for position behind me and giving me dirty looks because I get to board first. What’s amazing is that the majority of them are all ambulatory and walk down the jetway without any assistance at all and when we get to our destination pop right up and sprint out the plane.Am I wrong in being totally annoyed with this or is it just my imagination that this seems to be happening more and more. I also fly other airlines that have assigned seats and I never see the number of pre-boarders that I do when I fly Southwest. I understand that there are a lot of peoples who need assistance to get through the terminals to the gates because of the distances involved but to then get preferential seating for no real reason seems wrong to me.,handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

420,"I would prefer to write a complete review of this hotel after my stay, but my experience with Hyatt while trying to make reservations has been nothing less than miserable. My husband and I are planning to attend a conference in July 2024 that will be held at the Hyatt Buffalo. After registering for the conference, I followed the instructions on the conference website and attempted to make reservations for two rooms at the special conference rate. I reserved both an accessible room with a roll-in shower for my husband and myself (an amputee and wheelchair user) and a standard room for my aide. While I had no problem making a reservation for my aide at the conference rate, I was told by the Hyatt reservation agent that I would be charged nearly double for the accessible room because there were no accessible rooms within the conference room block. I contacted one of the conference planners to request assistance in getting both rooms at the conference rate. During the contract process, he explained, the conference planners were told by Hyatt sales staff it was impossible to contract for accessible rooms as they needed to be made available to all Hyatt customers. While this is a nice thought, it is just not true. This conference, and others like it are held annually. It is the custom of the meeting planners to make sure that there are accessible rooms available within the room block as there is a large percentage of individuals with disabilities who attend the conference, and they require accessible rooms. Attendees of this conference in previous years are surveyed about their need for accessible rooms so the planners can ensure that an appropriate number of rooms are available in subsequent years. I contacted Hyatt Global Customer Care Center. I was told I could not have an accessible room at the conference rate as the room block was sold out. So why could I confirm a standard room for my aide at the conference rate? The practice of charging one rate for a standard room and a higher rate for an accessible room is blatant discrimination, and a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act and, I imagine, any number of state and federal laws designed to enhance interstate commerce and to prevent similar acts of prejudice.

417,"I recently flew from Eugene Oregon to Seattle Washington on an Embraer ERJ 175 Alaska Airline in which I made reservations months in advance. Three days before I traveled I received a call confirming my power wheelchair and that it was to be gate checked and put in the only slot on the airline for power wheelchairs. Upon arrival at the airport, after checking in for my flight, I was told that my power wheelchair, which is 36 inches in total height, was too tall to fit on the aircraft. I have a tilt function, which I tilted back so that the hand grips were no higher than 33 inches, and was told that this was sufficient to fit on the aircraft. After we boarded and the plane was ready to take off, the cargo personnel came on the airplane to tell me that my power wheelchair would not fit on the airplane. I was told I had two options, one was to continue on with this flight and my power wheelchair would arrive with any luck later that evening as my destination was Washington DC and my second choice was I could be taken off the airplane yet there were no other flights out that day and they could not confirm there was even one the next day that could get us to Washington DC. I continue on with our travels and made it to Washington DC on the flights that we had reserved months in advance, and my power wheelchair arrived the next day at 11 AM. On return flight we have the similar plane from Seattle to Eugene and experienced the same problem, only this time my power wheelchair did not arrive at my home until a day and a half later. The bottom line is make sure that you do not fly with a power wheelchair that has a total height no greater than 33 inches on an Embraer ERJ 175 aircraft.

938,"Hi, I'm Pam, a proud Disney Adult! I completed an internship at Walt Disney World through Disney University, worked there for a few years, and am now a religious vlog watcher and travel agent! You would think that I would've known all that there is to know about Walt Disney World with that resume, but it wasn't until I traveled with family and friends with disabilities that I learned first-hand about accessible travel. To me, being a true ally to the disabled community is learning from their lived experiences, so I am grateful that I now have this knowledge to pass on along with all of my other tips and tricks! Walt Disney World is beloved for many reasons, and one of those is its vast options of accessible activities. I recommend reading the descriptions of the rides online ahead of time to see which ones not only seem accessible for you, but are experiences that you would enjoy! Some rides you can stay in a power wheelchair, while others require a transfer. Some rides have specific seats for those needing to transfer. One example is the brand new Tron ride at Magic Kingdom. The standard seat looks similar to a motorcycle, but there is a ""caboose"" in the back that is an accessible seat. If you are capable of transferring, one thing that I learned is that when the cast members (workers) ask ""can you transfer?"" first ask ""what are my options?"" One example for this is the Jungle Cruise ride in Magic Kingdom. My friend said that she could transfer and she did. The steepness of the stairs getting into and out of the ride were more steep than she thought. My daughter and I ended up helping her quite a bit, which we were happy to do, but we found out after that there was an accessible boat where she could have stayed in a wheelchair! Another great option is the Disability Access Pass (DAS) which is intended for guests who have difficulty tolerating extended waits in a conventional queue environment due to a disability. This pass allows guests to request a return time for a specific experience that is comparable to the current standby wait. This feature permits guests using the DAS to enjoy other experiences in the park instead of physically waiting in the standby line. Guests can register in person or pre-register via live video call (the guest with a disability must be present) and use DAS Advance pre-arrival planning. It is most convenient to use the DAS on the My Disney Experience app which is available for smart phones. This app has so many great features. Besides the DAS, two that are very helpful are the listed updated wait times and the ability to pre-order quick service food. Speaking of planning ahead, while there are wheelchairs and mobility scooters available to rent (for a fee) at the parks, it is much more economical and efficient to rent through an outside company. When mobility aids are rented through the park, they have to stay in the park. Renting through an outside company allows you to take the wheelchair or scooter anywhere. Some of the resorts at Walt Disney World are huge, so the walk from the hotel to the bus could be very exhausting. A company called Scooterbug is the exclusive provider of mobility devices for Walt Disney World. This distinction is important because they can drop off the scooter at your resort without you being present. With the possibility of flight delays or other mishaps, this service offers great peace of mind. One thing that we learned when asking the front desk for my friend's scooter: if you book through an agent, the device could possibly be under their name. Mobility devices and scooters aren't the only pieces of equipment available for rent (from other companies - Scooterbug only offers wheelchairs, scooters, and strollers). One example for this is that my friend rented an IV pole for her feeding tube. While enjoying is priority number one, it is also a good idea to know the medical services available ahead of time just in case. AdventHealth is the official healthcare provider of Walt Disney World. They have medical equipment for rent, urgent care services, virtual appointments available 24/7, in-park first aid, and a new full-service emergency room minutes from Walt Disney World. While we never like to think about these things happening on vacation, knowing that these services are conveniently available and accessible provides peace of mind when travelling. Walt Disney World has accessible room options in all of their hotels. It is important to think about what you need ahead of time so that questions can be asked before booking the room. Some of these questions are the height of the bed and whether you need a powered door to get in and out of the room. Only you know what you need best! Working with a travel agent who has experience in accessible travel can also help you to brainstorm some questions specific to your needs. I could talk about Walt Disney World all day long! If you have any questions, let them in the comments below and I’m happy to answer. You can also search and book on accessible GO today!",child handicap,1,0,1,0,0,0,disputed
1069,"My name is Danielle and I am a disabled content creator. My channels are called “Daniellevates” because the content is all about elevating ideas about disability and rare disease. Full-length vlogs feature accessibility reviews from my adventures in Boston and beyond.Short form content consists of series such as Breaking the 4th Wall of Disability, Accessible Design in the Wild, and more! Since birth, I have had an extremely rare technically undiagnosed neuromuscular disease. You can watch & subscribe to me here . This vlog is part two of a day trip from Boston to New York City, and the purpose of the trip was to see ""Into the Woods"" on Broadway! This vlog takes us from the outside of the St. James Theatre and to our seats. I now have my own mobility scooter, but during this trip I used a transport chair that I borrowed from my local senior center. While there are many aspects to having a disability that make life more difficult, we have to utilize the advantages when they come our way! Case in point: you can see our group receive the VIP treatment and skip the line to get into the theater safely. I was very pleasantly surprised by the proactive nature of the St. James Theatre. I selected an ADA seat for myself and an ADA companion seat for my friend, and they emailed me the night before to see if I would like to transfer into one of their seats or stay in my chair. When I indicated that I would be transferring, they said that they would store my chair and bring it back at intermission or anytime that I needed it. I would say that this email is not usual, so definitely plan ahead and ask any questions that you have ahead of time. For someone like myself, sitting in an ADA seat is a must. While I can do stairs with railings, they are draining and I am dependent on them having railings and not being too steep. Additionally, in an emergency, I would likely be one of the last ones out of the building anyways, so adding stairs as an obstacle is not a good idea. The show was amazing, and the rest of the video shows us dining in Times Square, our Amtrak train ride home (spoiler alert: half of us missed the train!), a recap of the trip and an awkward bathroom mishap, and a celebrity cameo from two comedy legends! Broadway lived up to the hype, and our little day trip was definitely chock-full of New York Moments. Key Takeaways If you need ADA seating for your health and safety, don't overthink it. Utilize these seats! Think of possible situations ahead of time (seating, bathroom, entering and exiting) and contact the theater with any questions. I should not have waited for them to contact me - this is a rare phenomenon in my experience! If a situation comes up that you didn't think of (like me wanting to get to my seat safely from the dense crowd), don't be afraid to ask for assistance. New York City is crowded. The streets aren't in good condition (I highlight this in part 1 of the NYC Vlogs). Plan ahead for what mobility aid you might need in these conditions. Make a list weeks before the show of what equipment and supplies that you will need. Add to this list whenever you think of something and pack your bag at least one day before. Once the show starts, be in the moment and enjoy! With all the traveling and hustle and bustle to just get to your seat, it can be hard to unwind. Let yourself take in your surroundings and immerse yourself in the show.",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

I called to change this and was told “because she did not have the same booking number as my itinerary there was nothing that they could do until 10 days before the travel date” even though I said it was not possible for me to travel without my aide! I tried, unsuccessfully, to resolve this sooner but finally 10 days before the flight, the resolution department agreed to put her on my flight at an additional cost of $480 which I reluctantly agreed to. I then contacted Alaska Air handicapped assistance to have my seat move nearer the front of the plane since I require an aisle chair. There I was told I should never have been put on the Vancouver to Seattle leg of the trip because it was in Embraer 160 plane which is not allowed to carry lithium batteries even in the main cabin. I called NCL travel resolution who said I should have known that it’s on their website but I pointed out that depending on how you query the mobility section of your website you may or may not be shown the warnings about the Embraer planes. They then rerouted us via Air Canada to our Newark destination. I asked him for my $480 back but they refused.",child handicap,1,0,1,0,0,0,disputed

I particularly liked this exchange (from the piece linked above) with some practical tips on how to make travel easier: “Allison: Accessibility in travel has come a long way, but we know there is still work to be done. From your perspective, what improvements could Delta and the industry make to our processes that would help your family? Donna: I was once on a flight with a woman who discreetly handed out notecards to customers that said she had an autistic child with her and to please be patient. I thought it was such a great idea. I know customers can work with Reservations and Airport Customer Service to ensure crews are notified of someone traveling with an invisible disability who may need additional assistance before boarding – I think others would benefit from knowing that too. [I’ve often thought that] having a pin or lanyard on for employees who have some experience with autism would be a massive help. It would also serve as an identifier for customers. I can sit here and tell you all about what to do, but when you have someone who’s lived it and understands it, that makes a big difference.”",child handicap,1,0,1,0,0,0,disputed

There were no handrails around the toilet either. The shower did not have a chair to sit on. The shower had only one hold bar that was opposite the controls and was under the shower head. You could not reach the hold bar while standing by the water controls. We had reserved a one bedroom suite and the bed was so wide that you could not ride a wheelchair or rollator to move upward towards the headboard to get onto the bed itself!

703,"I’ve been thinking of a few things that ease travel & thought I’d share in case others might find them handy. Backstory: Decades ago I temped a lady whose husband had left for work one day & vanished, gone without a trace; ~ 15 years ago I went on business trips with a colleague who gave me this tip; & I watch WAY too much true crime as I’m convinced that every solo foray leads to instant serial murder. Anyway, every time the coworker left her hotel room she made a brief note giving the time, date, destination, perhaps expected return. It wasn’t formal or elaborate, just a casual set of facts that would be invaluably helpful in trying to find her if she did in fact go missing. I don’t know if anyone else knew; it would be a good safety measure for almost anyone solo, no big deal, just a voice memo with dates & time erased on return or post-it by the phone or on the door that could be tossed on return, no need to involve others (could also add to dr. appt calendar to keep track of mundane things — ~ how often to bank, hair color, drycleaner, neighbor’s dog running loose, whatever(",pet,0,1,0,0,0,0,disputed

It is now a vacation rental, but I am struggling to connect with the folks that could benefit most from staying there. I have swapped a couple emails with hosts of this site who said they are looking at incorporating homes (vs strictly hotels) down the road. If anyone is aware of good resources currently available to get the word out it would be much appreciated if you shared them with me. Airbnb currently has the best search/filter function of the major booking sites, but it is lacking in detail (and I’m not sure people are aware they can filter for things such as zero step entry, wide doors, curbless showers, grab bars, etc). Here is a link to the home . I’ve received feedback regarding posting the master bed height (and lowering it as much as possible). Any additional input is welcome.

51,"For my 60th birthday year, Chet and I took my dream trip to Japan. We journeyed as far north as Nikko National Park and as far south as Nagasaki. We saw ancient temples and shrines, wild monkeys, amazing forests, and interesting museums. We ate at 7 11, Family Mart and Lawson convenience stores, restaurants, and local markets. We dipped our toes in the Japan Sea, climbed sand dunes, and even rode a camel. We traveled in a Mini Wink camper van from Japan Campers for three weeks, driving up and down crazy mountain roads, driving through rice paddies, and in the city traffic of Toyoko and Osaka. We camped at Michi No Eki roadside stops and other stops recommended by the Japan Campers app. We hope you will join us on this trip of a lifetime. We had a blast, and I hope you will enjoy joining us through this video series. We also lightly discuss accessibility that we see in our journey. This episode starts our journey from Japan Campers Narita, Japan to Nikko National Park. We spent the morning traveling pass beautiful places including rice fields, forests, stream, and small towns, and spent the afternoon starting our exploration of Nikko National Park. We are Betsy and Chet, and our oldest son, Alex. For 33 years, we thought Alex, had nonverbal autism, intellectual disability, ADHD, but a few years ago we found out that he has Phelan McDermid. Alex goes on many trips with us, but this time the plane trip is too far. Part of the reason we make these videos is to share the world with Alex and others who are unable to make a journey to Japan. We have no idea what Alex understands receptively, so videos are a way to visually communicate where we went for three weeks. He likes to use his eye gaze communication device to watch his vacation videos so now in a way he can see Japan with us. Our videos, Goal 1: Joyful Life are based on our family's journey and strategies we use to improve the quality of our life through meaningful leisure experiences. It is our hope to reach our number one goal of having a joyful life and to help others reach that goal too.

MobilityWorks was a big winner for our community. They offer regional rentals across the US. According to their website, “MobilityWorks offers wheelchair accessible van rentals to help you decide which accessible vehicle fits your needs. We also have wheelchair van rentals available to help you with occasional transportation needs — locally or nationwide. You can rent for a day, a weekend, or longer.” Wdavidstone shares: “I have had a positive experience with MobilityWorks in Nashville, TN. I think they are probably the only option here. I talked to them in the past 2 weeks and they are currently totally booked for July. I have also had a positive experience in Atlanta with AMS Vans.” Charliemitts recommends: “We recently used MobilityWorks in San Diego. Was a wonderful experience. They now have it set where you can pick and drop off at the airport. Mobility Works is s nationwide franchise that it is in most major cities. “ Patty Mayer also had a positive experience: “ MobilityWorks in San Diego CA has been very accommodating for us. Nice vans. Call ahead and reserve. They are currently trying to have their rentals right at the airport but had not been approved to do so as of April 1, 2023. We needed to get a wheelchair service to transport us to and from from airport to MW, which was very good but pricey on top of renting too.” United Access also got several votes. Jstorky1 shares: “United Access in Portland Oregon near the airport was good. I have been disappointed in the quality of vans we rented at Wheelers in Seattle. Got an old dented white van, my wife used the grab strap on the ceiling to get into the van and it pulled off and we had to pay for tge whole cost of repair. Some of the vans we rented in Maui had service lights lit up on the dash and bald tires. The proximity to the airport was the main reason we used Wheelers. They have pretty much a monopoly in Hawaii. I haven’t tried other companies in Seattle.” AMS Vans got a shout-out, as well. They serve the Atlanta Phoenix, Houston, Cincinnati, and New Jersey areas.

We forgot to factor in that Vienna is super busy because of the Christmas markets there. So I went hunting for a hotel. Vienna was booked solid. I finally went to sleep at midnight with no reservations. I woke at 7 a.m. and checked again. There was a hotel, near the train station, that had an open room. I booked it and we departed Krakow. *Be sure to check carefully what train station you are arriving and departing from, there are many. We arrive and find the Prizeotel by Radisson about a block from the train station. Easy to walk to. It was clean, efficient, and very wheelchair friendly. The only bad thing I can say about it is that it didn’t have an in-room coffee maker, but you could buy some in the lobby. Bed height was perfect, the shower was amazing, the staff great, very reasonable compared to other hotels. For years Paris has been my favorite city. Move over Paris, with Vienna’s wheelchair accessible subway, trams and buses I think I have a new favorite. The architecture is stunning. The people were friendly. The museums were mostly accessible. The Christmas markets are each different and beautiful (also packed). We visited the Belvedere Place to see the Klimt exhibit and the Military museum. Mostly we wandered around muttering ooohhh, ahhhhh. As with all cities this old there was a hunt for food that I could access. It is there but our budget was taking a hit, again, so we often visited bakeries, groceries and at in our room. We went 48 hours before our train trip to Munich. We then reported 20 minutes ahead of our train and off we went. We had a connecting train in Salzburg that we missed because the staff in Vienna didn’t notify the Salzburg staff of the wheelchair. But we got on the next train even though they said all the wheelchair spaces were booked. We were ushered into a wheelchair space anyway and rode the rest of the way to Munich. ***I forgot to mention that we spent the last night in Motel One across the street from the train station. A wonderful choice for wheelchair users. Also reasonably priced. ***If you are ever in Vienna and the wheel breaks on your largest suitcase you can get it repaired at Taschendoktor, Stumpergasse 36, 1060 Wien, Austria. Ph +43 1 5978701.

HANDICAP PARKING There was no handicap parking near our room. The curb to the parking area is not wheelchair or cane friendly. In order to avoid a dangerous fall, my husband had to leave me sitting in a wheelchair at the curb, & then drive onto the sidewalk to pick me up or let me out. When I inquired about a handicap space, no one seemed to have an answer. Training for the front desk & operators may be helpful. DISABLED ROOM After check in, they finally brought in a shower chair, but no shower mat. This is a huge fall risk for any guest. There are no bars in the shower & the shower head does not come down. The toilet riser was very loose & unsafe to use, & was delivered late. If you sat down the item would move out of place. This is a massive fall hazard. When I made the reservation I explained exactly what I needed in a hotel room; bars by the toilet, raised toilet, a portable shower chair, bars in the shower, but not necessarily an ADA room. We had to wait for shower mats, shower chair and toilet riser with arms. DANGEROUS GROUNDS The property is not handicap friendly! Or even safe for a disabled person. The property is very poorly lit & there are many areas with over grown brush & uneven pavement that made it difficult & dangerous to maneuver with a wheelchair or cane. There were multiple areas where a wheelchair could not get by. I sent this in writing to the Director, it is now 9 months later and he has yet to contact me. He keeps saying he wants to connect with me. Any of these areas of concern are fixable I let him know that I preferred to settle the situation directly with the property rather than write a totally negative review. He obviously does not care his guest's safety.",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

When I went to book it the wheelchair accessible room was already booked up. Being a nice hotel I figured a regular room would do. Thanks to Patch for going above and beyond I got into the wheelchair accessible room. I have to say in all my travels I have never seen a truly luxury accessible room until now. I messed up my camera so no pictures. There was enough room to get in, turn, park the chair for recharging. A nice loveseat area to relax. The bathroom was one to dream about. There was a bathtub with all of the rails and such. I couldn’t use it but hubby had a good hot soak. There were 2, yes 2 showers! Mine was a spacious roll-in with adjustable shower heights and hand held fixtures. The other was a standard with all the same fixtures and a rainfall showerhead. Check in was fast and super friendly. The attached restaurant was very nice. One of our favorite things was the valet service. Such a classy, professional and happy group. To haul my wheelchairs we have a very large truck. When we drove in the valet said that they couldn’t park it in the garage as it was too big. These guys kept it parked out on the street. They moved it around as needed and we had constant access to it. It wasn’t cheap but worth every penny.

So we went back through Zurich and down to Milan. The thing I noticed about the trains in Italy were that they were mostly lower. The helper at the station would carry a roll-up ramp and lay it down to cover the gap. If I could add to my luggage pile, without losing a husband, I would love one of my own. Milan is a big city. This was our splurge stopover. We used the Hotel Korner Duomo. It was beautiful. It had the biggest pain in the behind elevator I have ever seen. But the room made up for it. We were literally around the corner from the Galleria and Duomo. We walked across to the Monument Cemetery which was jaw dropping. We did little but wander the streets oooing and ahhhing.

1251,"Alaska is the last frontier, a wild, cold and crazy place with huge animals and insane weather–But it is also where I am from. It’s my home, and it is a large wild home, where exploration is a must, and the outdoors is part of life. Alaska is also concealed from the rest of the world. Blocked off by miles of ocean unless you want to drive for 4 days through Canada. Travel has to be by flight, and when you’re going to fly for 6 hours to get anywhere else, you might as well fly for 12 hours. So when I travel the world, I go far–to the warmest, most adventurous places I can find. ﻿ ﻿ I’m Andrew Kurka, an Alaskan and an Athlete on the US Paralympic Ski Team. I also like to think of myself as somewhat of an explorer. An explorer that is always looking for new and better ways to travel. Being an Alaskan, everyday life isn’t the most accessible. So I found ways, to adapt, to overcome, to continue doing the things I love to do. The hardest part was accepting my differences and my disability, realizing that I could do anything, I just had to do it differently. Then finding those that would support me in those endeavors.. The world isn’t built for us, and adapting can be hard. The more streamlined the better. That’s why I am excited to join the accessibleGO team. accessibleGO helps those who are freshly disabled or have had lifelong disabilities, travel with confidence and enjoy themselves on the GO, wherever that may be. ﻿ ﻿ I broke my back when I was 13 in an ATV accident. Prior to the injury I was a wrestler and avid outdoorsman, a hunter, a fisherman. But the things I miss the most about having legs that work, was the freedom, the freedom of being able to just walk outside and GO. Hike this hill, or ski that mountain. When my legs were taken from me, so was a portion of my life, and a portion of my identity. The athlete that was an awesome wrestler, the boy that would bike miles just to find a fishing spot. That person felt taken. For years I had tied my identity to the person who was built around these things, and then they were taken away. I struggled for two years, a young man lost. Alaska isn’t built for the disabled, we have pretty typical ADA standards but they aren’t typically met, especially in the winter time. Alaska, it’s wild! It’s the outdoors, and the outdoors isn’t built for us. It’s the best part about Alaska, but also the hardest part of being disabled. I struggled with these facts, trying to accept the things I loved. ﻿ ﻿ Then, when I was 15, I was nominated to be the Children’s Miracle Network Spokesman for Alaska. I traveled and met lots of other children with disabilities, learned their life stories and was inspired. I met a young man with terminal cancer who especially changed my life. He was 7 years old, but wanted to see and experience everything. He didn’t know how much time he had left, and he was completely aware of that fact. He just looked death in the eyes as if to say, “I know you’re coming for me, but I’ll make you work for it.” He was mature for his age, which was scary for me. I was 15, but he seemed like more of an adult. But he also didn’t have any fear, after all what did he have to lose? What did he do to deserve this? Nothing, but he was determined to at least give it his best shot at the life he was given. After meeting this young man, I sat down, and thought about my life. What was I even doing here? Why was I worried about who I used to be, why was I worried about my legs? Why was I sulking in the thoughts of the person I used to be? Instead of living the life of a fearless human that strives to at least experience what he can, while he can. That was when I started trying new things. Instead of focusing on the things that I used to do. I said, what can I do now? Or how can I do this? I started adapting, and in the process. I started living, I started skiing, I started playing hockey, I even started wrestling again. I started fishing, kayaking, hunting, canoeing. I started living life, I began my journey molding my life to my dreams. Seeking the experiences of a lifetime. Though they were done differently, I still did them. I pursued experiences in life and in the outdoors, in every way I could, hoping that it would one day provide me with the means of helping others, like that young man helped me. ﻿ ﻿ Today I own a Bed and Breakfast in Alaska, with multiple ADA accessible cabins, nested on an airstrip. I am working toward finishing my pilot license, I own a saltwater fishing vessel and have adapted my life to what I enjoy. I figured out how to do things with a disability. I am setting my life up so that I can do adventure camps, sharing that mindset and that freedom I have acquired with others. ﻿ ﻿ Andrew with his wife.While I still travel the world on the US Paralympic Ski Team, I am constantly learning to adapt to new situations and travel experiences. I know nothing is perfect but finding the best way to make things work is what I live for. Life will never be easy, but I’ll always remain willing to work hard and try. I have had a successful career as a skier. I have received a few paralympic medals and I have been crowned one of the fastest in the world. Yet I continue to pursue another Gold at the Paralympic Games while giving my all, to my business and my life. My journeys haven’t been without consequences, I have broken over 20 bones in my 31 years. But I will continue to push forward, living a fearless life and I hope you will too, in your own way.﻿ ﻿ This is who I am, it is my life, my goals and my dreams. It is the reason why accessibleGO and I have decided to create a partnership. So that we may help to inspire others. So that we can help answer questions that people may be unsure about. We can help make people with disabilities more comfortable away from home. So I can be an example and show you what I have made possible in my life. So that you may also do the same in yours. AccessibleGO can help people realize their possibilities and make those goals easier for them. Not to hold your hand, but to simply help you live the life you’ve dreamed of, filled with experiences, travel, and fun. Those objectives are what we partnered over. The fact that I live and experience everything I can, and we want that to be possible and comfortable for anyone with a disability. Sometimes it’s all about making one person smile, helping them to do that one thing they never thought they would experience again. Or at least giving them that opportunity.

1382,"(Advisory: Although this tour is willing to work with people of all abilities, it is still necessary for safety reasons that participants have strong grip capabilities with hands and arms, no neck issues, and strong swimming skills.) A few years ago when Covid restrictions first started to lift, I grabbed my husband and caught the first flight to Sint Maarten Island that we could get on. When we arrived, we practically had the island to ourselves when it came to tourists and found that tour guides were more than willing to work with me and my physical disabilities since they didn’t have to focus on large tour groups. However the one tour I wasn’t able to convince to work with me, was the new tours being offered using Sea Bob’s. (For people who are unfamiliar with what Sea Bob’s are, imagine a hand held jet ski engine that allows divers and snorkelers to fly over or under the water’s surface at speeds that match. Here is a link with more information.) You can’t imagine how angry that made me. My biggest pet peeve is when people make assumptions about what we are capable of. That is something we like to determine for ourselves. So when we got home, I started working on planning our next set of excursions for an upcoming cruise we had booked that was going to be stopping in Aruba. Usually when we visit Aruba just for a day, I always book us on a Motorcycle-Trike* tour that also loves to work with people of all abilities (that is another review I am working on); but I noticed a company, SeaBob Aruba, also offering SeaBob tours and I thought I would make my pitch to them to see about including me in the tour. Not only were they willing to work with me, they started explaining to me how they are very used to working with people of all abilities and would love to have us on the tour. I was so excited, even though the tour was still 7 months away. The day finally arrived when we docked in Aruba and I had my dream day ahead of me; a motorcycle tour all morning and Sea Bob’s all afternoon. The tour company met us right outside the dock and arranged a safe spot for me to load into the car and they were able to fit my entire wheelchair in the back of the van. Lucky for us that we were the only two people booked for the afternoon and ended up with a private tour. After a fast stop to pick up the trailer with the gear, we headed to the beach spot and our tour guides did a tutorial for us about how the equipment worked and how to use it safely in the water; while I worked to get my wetsuit gear on. Once I was ready, the incredibly strong tour guides lifted me up in their arms and carried me safely all the way to the water and carefully set me down and my husband joined us in the water. Once I am in the water I am a strong enough swimmer that I am ok without an aide; but my wetsuit does keep me floating at the surface. We were given our Sea-Bob’s and offered some time to familiarize ourselves with using the devices in the shallower water. As soon as we gave the cue we were feeling good with it, we headed out towards the sunken ship off-shore. On the way out, I took the chance to use the device under the water at top speeds and felt like Aquaman soaring under the water. The only downside was you can only stay under the water for as long as your breath lasts because we weren’t using any breathing apparatus. However this device is also used by scuba divers, so they can be used underwater for extended times if you had the correct equipment. On the way out, the guides pointed out some large turtles under us and I was able to swim right over them. After a few minutes of soaring through the water, our tour guides informed us we had reached the ship. They did forget to mention what type of ship, so I was a little overwhelmed when you look down and see a sunken WWII German warship that was HUGE and cracked in half. Plus everything always looks bigger under the water with your mask on. Once I finally got used to looking down at it, we took turns trying to fly down near it, but it was too deep for my husband and I to get too. Instead though, we were entertained by our tour guides who showed off their underwater superpowers and performed magic flying in and around the ship for the longest time. Was so cool watch and gave me fantasies of someday having that kind of breath control. When we were done exploring the ship, we headed back to an area more known for more large turtles and underwater sea life. This time when we spotted another giant turtle, I managed to swim right next to them for quite awhile. When I started to realize they were not comfortable with the Sea Bobs, I backed off and gave it more space. As we got closer to the reefs, so many fish started showing up that I thought I was in a musical number from the Little Mermaid. I only wish I knew the names of what I was seeing to tell you what was down there, but it was AMAZING! Before I knew it, the time had expired and it was time to head back to the beach. It was so sad having to head back, because my adrenaline was pumping so high from getting to experience all of that. Beyond how cool the Sea Bob experience was, there is something about accomplishing a task that someone else said you were incapable of that gives you this high about being alive and for just that brief moment in time, I have a feeling like I am capable of anything. These magical Seabob devices gave me the ability to reach areas above and under the water that I would have never been able to reach on my own due to my legs not kicking anymore… so I was in love. Plus these tour guides never doubted me and let me try everything without any hesitations, giving me that brief moment where I didn’t have to feel like I stood out with my disabilities. I wish I could explain how good of a feeling that is (to me at least), but as the guides carried me out of the water and back to the van to de-wetsuit; I was overwhelmed and didn’t know if I wanted to cry or just grin because I was so happy. They were just lucky it was too far for me to summersault back to the waters edge or I would have been back on that SeaBob for another lap around the bay. I forgot to mention that they do offer a photo package that was very reasonable and then you get a ton of photos and movies sent to you digitally that is so much easier than trying to photograph yourself at the same time you’re trying to control the Bob. However it might be interesting to also attach your own go-pro strapped to your head for a first-person perspective, but I warn you that you go much faster than you can imagine under the water and not sure if it will stay attached? But definitely get the package because they capture all of the great moments with you in them, not just what you saw happening. To me, this was the most perfect day of activities on an island I could fathom for myself. I got to fly above in the morning on the Trike; and then flew below with the Bob in the afternoon. There was so much adrenaline pumping that I was awake all night just glowing (don’t worry, it wasn’t a sunburn). Not only was the Sea Bob tour amazing itself, working with a company like SeaBob Aruba that understands that people with all types of physical abilities can do way more than we are ever given credit for; meant everything to me. The tour guides were phenomenal as tour guides and as human beings. Felt like we had also made new friends that day too**. So now I have 2 things that I always HAVE to do when I get to Aruba, but I think the Sea-Bob’s have secured my #1 spot. **(And to help my tour guide who could not stop whistling a song he couldn’t remember the name or lyrics to; it was Scorpions doing “Wind of Change.” I hope that helps?) 🏍 Trike Tour Review Coming soon 🏍",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

However I believe this will be quite different because for all of that past travel, we’ve always flown one of the major airlines here (American Airlines, Delta, United, Southwest, etc) and on these airlines the policy is pretty much the same across the board: I’m able to remain in my wheelchair and check it right at the gate I’m allowed to bring a carry-on bag containing medical supplies in addition to whatever the standard cary-on allowance for that specific airline and class of ticket I’m allowed to carry on yet another bag containing my Freewheel (and its parts), which is essentially a 3rd wheel that attaches to my wheelchair allowing me to navigate some rougher terrain …all this for no additional charge. I’m starting to get concerned as we look at flights between countries within South America (ex Ecuador to Argentina) and also flights with the same countries.

When they arranged for the rooms, they provided their contact person with our specific needs, i.e. a mobility handicapped room for one person (son, 34) with a connecting or adjoining room for 2, so we can assist our son as needed. The reservations clerk took note of the wedding party and seemed very competent. When I received email confirmation after the rooms were booked, the following note was at the bottom of the confirmation page: “Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center will make every effort to accommodate the below requests, however they are not guaranteed. HANDICAPPED; C1” The hotel front desk refuses to discuss, saying I must use the 800# for reservations. The reservations people say they are powerless to guarantee the handicapped room. My granddaughter has reached out to her contact person who set up the block of rooms, but has been ghosted for over a week. We are only planning to stay one night, so my son can survive an overnight without a shower. What is not negotiable is the installation of grab bars at the toilet, as he is unable to transfer without them. The lack of a guaranteed handicapped room puts us in an impossible situation.

203,"We had been to Munich years ago so were a little familiar with it. We booked the Eurostar Book Hotel. It was very close to the main train station. We had an accessible room and it met all the needs we usually look for. I will say Europe in general knows how to do wheelchair accessible bathrooms. The one draw back of the hotel was the front door. It was one big twirling entrance. They really should make an accessible door to the side. I let them know that. Munich was packed. It is Christmas Market season and it was crowded. We have learned that if I want to see more then other peoples legs and backsides we have to visit the markets during the week days. Not as pretty without all the twinkly lights but easier on my nerves. I was proud of myself for not running over too many people, but the urge was real. A person (usually female and young) would look right at me as I was moving through the crowd and then step right into my path and stop. I resisted the urge but it was difficult. On our last day in Munich we were out wandering. A block from our hotel I went to cross the road, yes the pedestrian light was green, and an impatient driver decided that he should have the right of way. Thank goodness my wheelchair is very sturdy. I took a broadside hit from the idiot. My chair stayed upright and I made sure my arms were inside so the injuries were limited. I heard the gasp of the onlookers but not one came to help. So important note **make sure you buy a sturdy wheelchair. Munich was very easy to get around and the public transit is all wheelchair accessible.

Introduce yourself and your company: Idan Meir is the Co-founder and CEO of RightHear, an innovative startup on a mission to turn public spaces into accessible environments for people with spatial orientation challenges, including people who are blind or visually impaired. Idan is originally from Israel but relocated with his family to Rockville, Maryland in 2021. Idan holds a bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Business from The Open University of Israel. He loves building companies, running, and eating hummus. Not necessarily in that order. RightHear provides real-time audio descriptions to help the blind interpret and understand their surroundings. They have a free app on iOS and Android, over 2,500 accessible locations worldwide, and an ever-growing user base and community. RightHear has partnered with leading international brands like McDonalds, Microsoft, and Costa Coffee to improve accessibility compliance as well as promote inclusion. Here is a video of the app in action. How did the idea for this company come about? It happened almost by accident. Along with my partner, Gil Elgrably, we had created a technology to offer virtual on-the-spot coupons to shoppers based on Apple’s iBeacon technology. iBeacons are small self-powered Bluetooth transmitters that can be placed on walls and roofs in a retail location. But the business model wasn’t making sense. We needed to build a very large user base for this to work and that was turning into a very large challenge. Then, during a 24-hour hackathon sponsored by the Ra’anana municipality, the Tel Aviv suburb in which RightHear is based, we had an insight. Rather than marketing the app to end users, what if we pitched it to the venues as a way of making their space accessible to people with visual impairment? We didn’t even know if blind people used smartphones or apps since they’re so visual, but we put together a prototype in the hackathon and, the next day, the Ra’anana municipality connected us with several blind people in the city. They were blown away, they were so excited about it, even though we didn’t have a product yet. And RightHear was born! What accessibility challenges does your company help users over come? RightHear mimics the function of a venue’s directory board, whether that’s a sign reading “Macy’s this way, restrooms that way” in a mall, or orienting a visitor inside a university’s administration building. When users with the RightHear app on their phone approach the virtual sign, the app speaks to them about what’s nearby. For example: “The admissions office is 100 feet ahead to the right. Hours are 9:00am to 5:00pm, Monday through Friday” or “Restrooms 50 feet to the left.” Any memorable stories from your community that you'd like to share? A person that your product particularly impacted? You know, we've got this user, Hani. She's one of those people who you just can't forget. One day, she was heading home with her guide dog, but something went off. Her dog got lost, couldn't find their usual way home. Can you imagine the stress? So there she was, a little lost, a little unsure. But then, she remembered RightHear was on her phone. She fired it up, and our app guided her safely back home. It's pretty wild when you think about it, right? A simple app turning a moment of anxiety into one of empowerment Ever since that day, Hani and RightHear, we're like best friends. She takes us everywhere she goes, and I mean everywhere - even when she's traveling abroad. New city, new country, new everything, but there's RightHear, helping her find her way, keeping her independent. When you get a story like Hani's, it hits you. It's not just about building a product. It's about changing lives, making people feel more in control, more confident. And that, that's the real magic of what we do at RightHear. Why does accessibility matter to you? I believe that everyone should feel able, included, and empowered everywhere. Therefore, our aim at RightHear is to make the world a more accessible place for everyone. At RightHear, when we say universal access, we mean universal access. Our beacon technology removes physical barriers to access. But that’s not enough – we also want to remove financial barriers to access. This is why our app on iOS and Android is 100% free to users today, and always will be free, it is vital to us to ensure that the benefit of accessibility and independence for users should not come at a cost. What are some of your other favorite accessibility startups in the field right now? You know, we're living in an exciting time. All around us, startups are using technology to break down barriers and build a more inclusive world. It's inspiring, really, to see how much of an impact we're collectively making. Let me share a few of my favorites: First up, we've got OKO by Ayes . These guys are doing something pretty cool. Their app is all about making intersections easier to navigate for blind folks. Just point your phone's back camera at a crossing, and voila, the app picks up the pedestrian signal. A simple concept, but it's really changing the game for people. Next, we've got Lotus Labs . They're taking things up a notch with a wearable ring. No, not like a magic ring, but close enough. You just point with the ring, and you can control stuff at home. It's almost like they're turning us into superheroes, right? And then there's ReBokeh . This one's a bit different, it's for people with moderate vision impairment. The app lets you create custom video filters based on your unique needs and environment. Think of it like adjusting the world's focus to suit your eyesight. It's innovative, personalized, and just plain cool. Each of these startups is challenging the status quo, pushing boundaries, and reshaping how we think about accessibility. And that's the beauty of it all, right? It's not just about building products; it's about making a difference, one innovation at a time. We're not just in the business of accessibility, we're in the business of empowerment. How does somebody access & get started using RightHear? Users can simply download the app on iOS here and Android here . It’s free to download and use, we don’t even require a sign up or login, we collect no personal information on our users. For businesses and venues, we offer a quick and simple solution that allows then to ensure that their buildings are accessible to all people, including those who are blind or visually impaired. We work with companies from local stores and restaurants, museums, hospitals, airports, all the way up to governments, global companies such as Microsoft, McDonalds and others.",child pet handicap,1,1,1,0,0,0,disputed

69,"Jump to final paragraph if you don’t like details… Looking for lodging. Everyone has different needs. My husband is hemiplegic and full-time in a wheelchair. Here are his needs. His wheelchair does a 12” vertical lift. So he can do a slide board transfer in and out of bed as long as the bed top is between the lower and higher setting of his wheelchair seat. (Otherwise, he uses a Hoyer lift which means no platform beds.) That means he needs 35” to the left of the bed for the wheelchair and a moveable nightstand because he can only move to the right, so getting out of bed means I back the wheelchair up to the head of the bed. He uses a Hoyer lift to move to toilet so there must be room for it to move into bathroom and turn to hug the toilet. (44”x22” base) Nice to have: roll in shower with grab bar and attached seat, roll under sink, roll under desk/table, no threshold balcony. As others have said, VRBO and AirBnB either filter to nothing, or accessibility is exaggerated. Photos don’t highlight what needs to be seen so lots of communication is needed, The Hilton Grand Vacation properties look good. Has anyone stayed at their Ocean 22 or Ocean Enclave properties?

I had gotten one last year but it started falling apart (literally) after having it for less than two weeks. The owners had just had it ‘serviced’ and was told of the unsafe and unrepairable conditions; however, decided to sell it for cheap so as to not have to deal with it. I have statement from our local dealership and mechanic stating that the dealer where the previous work had been performed knew of the condition(s)…and also have the invoice from them where they made the statement of the condition. The organization (FAAST) here in Florida that I wen through to get that van refuses to be of any assistance and rejected my application for a new loan claiming our credit rating was not to their standards (they are federally funded)…however, the only difference between now and the first application is this horrid van and the only one that can get/have anything removed from the credit report is them (FAAST) and they refuse to.

Today I bring you something that I hope will solve a nightmare for other wheelchair travelers, that I suffer from all the time with my luggage. I’m not even sure how I got on the mailing list for a company called Phoenix Instinct from the U.K., but I recently got an email about a sale for their luggage trolley system for chairs. Typically I would ignore ads that I don’t subscribe too, but this sounded too good to be true, so I had to check it out. What I found was the coolest invention. A luggage trolley that fits multiple size bags (you can change them out as needed), that just hooks on to the back bar of your wheelchair. Plus they put some serious wheels on the trolley to be able to go over different surfaces. (Reminded me of the wheels Whill chairs uses.) Those of you like me, who have tried to balance the bags on our laps or push them in front of the chair while alternating free hands; know what a pain in the tushy luggage can be when we travel. Especially when our focus is more about the safety of our chair while it travels, so we don’t need any extra headaches when traveling like luggage not designed for us, Saving up for a set myself; so as soon as I have one, I will come back and update this review. But… if anyone else happens to have these or orders them, please come back here and share with us your review of the bags. Would be helpful for everyone. Or better yet, if you have any other ideas for good wheelchair luggage; please share with us all?

Austin has a local app called RideAustin. I’ve never tried these services, but my experience with getting a taxi at night is pretty pathetic. For example, in Memphis I had to choose between showing an untrained driver using his buddy’s van how to use the ramp and riding not tied down or wheeling back to my hotel 10 miles away on dark, unfamiliar streets.

212,"Cologne was a new city for us. We found it to be a beautiful, walkable (rollable) city. The tram system was wheelchair accessible. Most of the museums and sights, even the Dom (cathedral) was easy to access. We wandered all over. So far the Christmas Markets in Cologne rank near the top of the list. But we quickly learned that to see anything I had to go in the daytime. The markets so packed that all I saw were legs. But the beer was great! We stayed at the Dorint Hotel Heumarkt. It was not the cheapest in town but the location was superb. The accessible room was great. Unfortunately they had overbooked that room. We got upgraded to a suite after the first night. That room was beautiful and very functional if you can take a few steps on your own. I made the mistake of not calling ahead of time to make sure it was the accessible room. Lesson learned. Each country has it’s own rules regarding wheelchair travel. Since we are doing all but one segment by rail we have much to learn. When leaving Cologne I knew to go to the train station early and ask about our seats. I asked at the information station and the attendant asked us to come back in an hour. She didn’t speak english. We did just that and got all set up. The train trip was very delayed and we ended up missing the connecting train from Berlin to Prague. Again we went to the information station and asked questions and got on the next train. As the rest of the trip goes along we find that while the trains may be accessible they are certainly not as dependable as they once were.",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

I know my children will face the same future and hopefully not have a harder path in front of them. Upon learning of my own diagnosis, we made some decisions with doctors and moved out of state for a better medical future and out of the cold climates. My spouse sold his very successful business and we started from scratch in hopes of providing the best future possible to our children.

Not only were we celebrating our 40+ anniversary but we were celebratng while I'm still able to enjoy such a beautiful place. We were also going so my husband can finally fulfill his dream of going halibut fishing, as this was our first cruise ever the night before we were due to dock for our excursion we stopped by Guest Services to ask how to go about requesting a wheelchair since we opted not to take my own. We were told to call down and request the chair 30 minutes before the time listed on ticket. We did just as instructed and were told my chair would be on it's way. Not even 5 minutes later we get a call letting me know as soon as dock official cleared the ship they would come for me. Announcement was made that ship had been cleared and no one came. We called second time and still no one. After 3rd call finally someone came, by the time we reached the area where we were to meet we instructed the bus had left 10 minutes ago. We were devasted but the man who they told us was director of excursions could care less. I even asked if I could pay for private transport to wherever the boat would be and he refused. What a horrible start to our dream cruise. He told us we could select a different excursion but we told him the main reason we chose this entire trip was for the halibut fishing one. We finally realized what a futile attempt it was getting anywhere with this man. I calmed my husband down and myself and told him we would make the best of the remaining days.

We’re bringing it to accessible GO as part of our “Community Voices” series, where community members share insights, tips, and tricks from their travel experiences. Other posts include community member Danielle and her review of seeing a show on Broadway . Nestled in the burgeoning college town of Cedar City, Utah, lies two gems of accessible leisure travel: Cedar Breaks National Monument and the Utah Shakespeare Festival . Limited mobility is not a problem at either venue, and there’s every reason to go. In July 2023, my husband Lou and I, together with our caregiver Josh, took in the remarkable beauty of western Utah as well as two superb Shakespeare performances over the course of a two-day visit to Cedar City. Here’s what we recommend: Where to Play Cedar Breaks National Monument A very pretty, half hour drive from Cedar City, Cedar Breaks National Monument is a welcomed breath of fresh air, quite literally. At an elevation of 10,000 feet, accessible view points lookout over colorful geological formations and abundant alpine vegetation. During summer months, wildflowers carpet the area. Taking in the view of Cedar Breaks National Monument During our July 2023 visit, Point Supreme Overlook was closed because it was being given a loving overhaul. Check here for park updates. We drove on to the alternate lookout, which was still mind-blowing and wheelchair accessible. Utah Shakespeare Festival Play on! After a global plague and a monarch change, we headed back to live theatre for the first time since 2019. At the Utah Shakespeare Festival, the magnificent acting, clever stage craft, and glorious costuming for Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night’s Dream demonstrated that the hiatus did not lower the exceptional quality of performances one iota. Both plays proved that the festival is still on its A-game – on-stage anyway. When it comes to accessibility, however, we still hit a few minor glitches. Compared to four years ago, we were delighted to see remarkably more audience members, and even staff, attending performances using mobility devices at the Utah Shakespeare Festival. It’s an auspicious sign of accessibility for all. Traveling with a disability can mean having to alter plans unpredictably. My energy levels were such that we hoped to swap tickets for an alternate performance. Luckily, we could. Noah D. at the boxoffice happily exchanged the tickets. We appreciated the festival’s flexibility. Noah also enabled us to check out the actual seats in the outdoor theatre so I could decide whether I’d be more comfortable in the theatre seat or my wheelchair. Great guy. Okay, what still needs work: In any theatre, wandering, pre-show audience members and special seating arrangements can make navigating a mobility device challenging. Uniformed ushers were cheerful, plentiful, and dutiful when approached, but as noted in our 2019 festival visit, they did not offer to ease passage. To read more click here . Wheelchair users are blocked from entering the gift shop despite ADA ramp At the gift shop, we could not enter via the ADA ramp for the two performances we attended. Aubree Rasmussen, Guest Services Manager, ensured us that the ADA gift store ramp would be cleared for accessibility moving forward. Where to Stay Two hotels, both alike in accessibility, In fair Cedar City, where we lay our heads… While visiting Cedar City, we’ve stayed at the following two hotels, which are located across the street from one another and a ten-minute drive to the Shakespeare Festival. There are accessibility pros and cons with each. Courtyard Marriott Courtyard Marriott, Cedar City Ask for Room 225 at the Courtyard Marriott. The hotel offers accessible rooms with roll-in showers, but from what we saw, those rooms are smaller. Room 225 is more spacious with two queen beds and a pullout sofa, perfect for traveling with a caregiver or family travel. Bathroom There is an accessible tub with a foldout bench in Room 225. Unfortunately, the length of the shower hose barely extends far enough to reach the person sitting on the bench. A/C Unit Whoa, talk about clanky. Each room has its own A/C unit built-in and exposed within the room. Luckily, the weather cooled down enough at night that we could turn the unit off completely. Indoor Pool The indoor hotel pool has a mobility pool lift. However, when we called to book our stay and confirm there was a pool lift, the hotel staff was unaware that the lift was inoperable. Management Responsiveness While we were there, hotel management tried to fix the pool lift, but was unsuccessful. Instead, they compensated us for the inconvenience. Courtyard Marriott, Cedar City 1294 South Interstate Drive, Cedar City Utah, USA, 84720 P: 435-867-7300 La Quinta There’s plenty of room to roll around in Room 104 at La Quinta. The accessible room has one king-sized bed with space enough for a roll-in cot. We stayed very comfortably in Room 104 while traveling with a caregiver. Bathroom Wonderful. Indoor Pool Really great. Pool lift was operational at the time of our visit. Noise Level There was only one drawback to Room 104: the noise. The room is very conveniently located on the ground floor near a side-exit door. We heard the door bang shut every time a guest went in or out.

My husband is full-time in a wheelchair and I use a Hoyer lift to transfer him. So I need 1) a bed whose frame is >8” off the ground, 2) doors wide enough and rooms that allow a wheelchair to maneuver, 3) a toilet that can be accessed with the lift, and 4) a no threshold shower and floating vanity. This Townhouse had the first 3, and since we were staying just 2 days, we could forego the shower. The Townhouse has 3 levels with an elevator to go from garage level to living level, to bedroom level. The host was extremely responsive and helpful. He did measurements for me in advance; suggested which bedroom would be best for toilet access; warned me that there was carpet. He wanted to make things work. He was adamant that the wheelchair footprint could not be bigger than 30”x40” for the elevator and he was right! We brought a transfer wheelchair and used that in the townhouse, and parked the electric wheelchair in the large garage and used it when we were out. I was relieved that the Hoyer lift fit in the elevator, so whatever floor I needed to do a transfer on, it was easy. The bedrooms have carpeting so it took a little muscle to move the lift around. While the roads and sidewalks in Atlantic City were not very wheelchair friendly, the boardwalk was wonderful. Miles and miles of smooth ride along the shore with views of the water, piers crowded with people fishing, and beaches, and families enjoying bikes and other strange vehicles. We went all the way from the non-commercial end by the Basin, to the Steel Pier. The Edwin B Forsythe NWR 8-mile wildlife drive is lovely even for non-birders, and there were 2 trails that were completely wheelchair accessible: 5’ wide and 1% grade.",child pet handicap,1,1,1,0,0,1,disputed

My sister is able to walk short distances with a walker but it’s necessary to have a shower with a only a small curb and a hotel bed of manageable height. We booked a room with a roll-in shower then phoned the hotel and spoke with someone in reservations to verify room accessibility. The staff was amazing!! They sent someone from housekeeping to measure the bed (platform) from top of mattress (21”) to floor as well as verify the shower’s accessibility. The shower was indeed roll-in, with a bench and safety bars. There were additional safety bars in practical areas around the bathroom. See attached pics. Needing to arrange a wheelchair (manual) rental, the Guest Services/Concierge desk suggested using scooterbug.com. The wheelchair was delivered by scooterbug.com to the hotel bell desk and was available for us to pick up on check-in. Wheelchair was easily returned to the bell desk upon our departure. There is a free tram which runs between Park MGM, Aria and Bellagio hotels making access between these fairly easy. Vegas is big! Even with the tram there is lots of walking! We found Ubers in Vegas to be very accommodating too. After reading many of posts (nightmare stories) on accessiblego.com, I knew to check with the hotel a number of times prior to our arrival to emphasize the importance of getting the accessible room we reserved. Kudos to Park MGM Las Vegas for coming through! A great trip!! Glad we went! Thanks to the accessiblego.com community for the good advice and tips.",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

632,"I am excited to join the Accessible Go Community as a travel expert. My particular expertise is traveling with Multiple Sclerosis. In that regard I have led workshops for MS groups. My wife, Martha, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1994 after having some problems with her hand. We were lucky that the disease was recognized immediately and treated. After about 10 years of relapsing/remitting MS the disease gradually turned to secondary progressive MS. Having two children and working full time made for a pretty demanding situation. Our children were only 3 and 6 when Martha was diagnosed but fortunately Martha was able to remain active with their activities and her career until the mid 2000s when the MS had advanced to a stage that she could no longer work. At this time, Martha’s MS has progressed to the point where she is unable to perform the activities of daily living without assistance and requires a wheelchair for mobility. Martha and I worked for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Martha was an Environmental Engineer and I was an Atmospheric Research Scientist. Additionally, I was a union officier (AFGE) and provided disability counseling, especially in regards to reasonable accomodations and other rights for the disabled. We are now both retired. Martha and I love to travel and explore new places and activities. We started out our lives together with a honeymoon in Greece and have traveled ever since. We are trying to visit every state and see as many National Parks as possible. As Martha's MS has progressed traveling has become a little more difficult and requires a good deal more planning. With a significant amount of planning this past year we visited two Hawaiian Islands (Oahu and Hawaii), Barcelona (Spain), took a cruise of the western Mediterranean (from Barcelona with ports of call including Marseille, Genoa, Naples, Messina, and Valletta), visited San Diego, Hilton Head Island, Myrtle Beach, Congaree National Park (outside Columbia, SC), Roanoke and the Blue Ridge Parkway several times, and Washington, DC.",child handicap,1,0,1,0,0,0,disputed

Additionally, one person's needed equipment and services may differ from what is necessary for others. Political action is needed. We in the disability community and our various advocacy and research organizations like the Amputee Coalition, Disability Partners, Spinal Cord Injury, Brain Injury, et. al. should lobby the White House and Congress to ask the Interstate Commerce Commission to convene a series of conferences on meeting the needs of travelers with disabilities. From the conferences, enforceable standards could be developed with mandatory penalties with some teeth. These standards should apply not just to hotels, but air travel, restaurants, grocery stores, and anywhere a person with disabilities may need to travel. Senator Tammy Duckworth has been a leader in sponsoring legislation that would benefit those with disabilities, but she is just one Senator. It is also our responsibility as citizens to communicate with our elected leaders about the protections that we need. Let us hold our representatives’ feet to the fire.

230,"My husband and I had to get on an airplane really early in the morning so we stayed a night in Las Vegas NV. I specifically asked for a wheelchair accessible room and bathroom with appropriate grab bars. I'm a below the knee amputee and legless right now. I don't have a lot of experience in a wheelchair accessible room. When we first came to our room, I could barely roll in the door. There was a chair on one side of the door and a dresser on the opposite side. There were 2 queen size beds and the bathroom was horrible. I only used it twice. The first time wasn't too bad but at 3:30am, on our way to the airport I was using the grab bar at the toilet. There was no grip and I fell, slammed my stump, right leg (new reconstructive surgery) on the floor and my hand also on the right side slammed against the sharp corner of the shower. As you can guess I broke my hand. My husband thought it wasn't broken but we went down to the front desk anyway. It took SIX hefty security guards to decide I should probably wrap at least 2 fingers together (no brace or even a popsicle stick) with coband. It took them an hour and a half to decide what to do, even though my husband and I were telling them we were going to miss our flight. When we got to the airport we found out we had definitely missed our flight and had to wait 2 more hours for the next flight to Denver CO. While waiting my husband found some cardboard for a temporary brace for my fingers. To make a really long story short we ended up in Bentonville Arkansas. From Denver to Bentonville we rode in a really small plane with 45 people in it. They tried to get me down to our seats in row 19 in an isle chair but the isle was SO narrow it wouldn't fit, let alone with me on it! It was crazy. We were gone for a week. The Marriott in Bentonville was just about perfect except for the grab bar by the toilet again. I made my husband help me get onto the toilet and off again. On the way home, they “lost my wheelchair “ between Bentonville and Las Vegas. In Denver I had to sit in an isle chair for over 2 hours. (My butt is bigger than an isle chair and it was giving me a huge wedgie! 😳) When we got to Vegas, my wheelchair was waiting for me. The Denver airport apparently kept my wheelchair down with the luggage, as not to lose it. I about lost it. We decided to stay in Mesquite Nevada on the way home. We got there at 2 am. We had, again requested a wheelchair accessible room and bathroom. I had NO idea that they use accessible rooms for people with pets. It wreaked of animal pee and poo. I'm HIGHLY allergic to dogs and cats. There were 2 full size beds (my wheelchairdidn't fit between the two beds), and the bathroom was also a joke. My husband had to be my human forklift in the bathroom again. On our way home to Cedar City UT we decided that my hand didn't look right so we went to Instacare where I was told my hand was broken in 3 places and would require surgery. 🤦‍♀️ One week after surgery my husband was asked to go help setup another Walmart store in…you guessed it…in Las Vegas. I said absolutely not. He went alone and my best friend was able to come stay with me. Needless to say, I KNOW the exact questions to ask for next time. We're actually going to Hawaii in February and the Philippines in April. I'm worried about leaving the USA but I already know Hawaii really well because we used to live there. But in the Phillipines? I wouldn't go except our son is getting married. OK that's my rant. 😁",child pet handicap,1,1,1,0,1,0,disputed

1019,"Last month we stayed just 1 night (thank goodness!) at the former Margaritaville Resort in Pensacola Florida. The new ownership had revamped the place since we’d booked the stay and the rooms looked totally different. The beds were so very high, even I needed a step stool to climb into them. And my poor hubby could not get in. So I called reception, they said they had accessible rooms where the beds were definitely lower and could send a valet up to move our things. But they refused to show us the room before moving us! So what if 1 thing was better while somethine else we required was worse? We were leaving to meet friends for dinner and I figured I would speak with the manager upon our return, to see the accessible room in hopes of moving; basically going over the front desk gal’s head since she said they have a policy to not show guests vacant rooms. Yet when we returned from dinner, they’d sent maintenance in to remove the box springs from both beds, so now when you climbed into bed, your body weight sunk the mattress down so you couldn’t get out of the wooden frame surrounding the mattress! I had to pull myself out; my disabled hubby could not figure out how extricate himself from the mattress at all. We’d stayed at 2 dozen hotels so far on our 38-day roadtrip and not experienced such a problem! But be careful - the new management is not accommodating.

251,"My hubby is a right leg above knee amputee and we just returned from an amazing trip to the above destinations. I am writing this to encourage others to continue to travel and work through the challenges that travel poses to those with differing abilities. My hubby wears a prosthetic but has never recovered fully from the amputation so needs a walker for mobility & a scooter/wheelchair for long distances. We flew to Belgrade - Bozeman, MT with our two adult children. Arriving at the airport, we invested (take change as some airports require coins) in a luggage cart. I retrieved a wheelchair and away we went to our gate and flew Southwest. We checked his rollator and used the wheelchair in the airport. Seating was tight but manageable. Landing in Belgrade - Bozeman, MT, airline attendant brought another wheelchair to the plane door and pushed hubby to retrieve our luggage. In advance, we rented a large van (from Budget Rent-A-Car) to accomodate all our luggage, his walker, and a rented scooter. We did have difficulty finding a place that would rent us a scooter for the limited time we needed (7 days.) However, I highly recommend Price Rite Medical Equipment. They provided awesome customer service and acted upon our requests quickly. The scooter was delivered to our first hotel prior to arrival and they picked up from our hotel at the end of the trip. The scooter they recommended easily adapted to inclines and kept its battery strength throughout our trip. (We did charge it every night. The scooter we use at home,Go Go Pride, would never have met the inclines and sometimes rocky paths we encountered.) However, we couldn’t figure out how to break down the scooter to fit it into the van. Thank God we had our adult children who lifted the scooter in/out of the van. It probably could have been broken into smaller pieces but we didn’t want to wait for the company to come demonstrate for us and lose time site seeing. Yellowstone is very accessible to those with mobility issues. We stayed on the main loop road and did not do any back country hiking. MOST typical tourist sites (geysers, basins, canyons, etc.) have wooden boardwalks that make seeing these astonishing sites possible. Don’t miss Artist’s Point! I would suggest travelling with snacks as there can be long distances between food stops. Gasoline stations were adequate for our travels. The Grand Tetons are so close to Yellowstone, you should not miss visiting them. We also took the Jackson Hole Aerial Tram at the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort to the summit of Mt Rendezvous. My husband rode the scooter onto the tram which holds 100 people and gave us a disability discount! We had brunch at a TINY restaurant on the summit. The restaurant was too small to fit the scooter but we ate at an outside picnic table. “They” were working on making better disability accomodations for the restaurant while we were there. My hubby was able to drive the scooter along the Skywalk and take in the 360-degree view of the Tetons. We also took a boat ride on Lake Jenny. Boarding and deboarding from the scooter were a little challenging. In Cody, we would have loved to see a rodeo but it was closed for the winter. There were a few other opportunities we missed because of travelling in Sept. However, we were advised to avoid the summer crowds. The Buffalo Bill Cody Museum in Cody, WY was educational, enjoyable, accessible and well done, but if I had to shorten our trip, I would have skipped this visit. Upon our return to Bozeman, we had time to visit the Museum of the Rockies. For those of you who enjoy archaelogy & dinos, this was also fully accessible with unique displays from other similar museums we have seen. Our hotel reservations varied in their ADA accomodations: Belgrade Holiday Inn (Belgrade, MT) offered free delicious breakfast and friendly, helpful customer service.. Room was large enough for scooter and walker. Nice place to stay. Reasonable price. Canyon Lodge offered convenience of staying in Yellowstone. (Distances just getting into the park can take you 2 -3 hours which is why we decided to splurge and stay in the park 1 night.) We had to travel by car to get to the cafeteria, souvenir shop, etc. from the hotel room. Walking paths appeared too rocky for the scooter. The room was very small for 4 adults and disability equipment but we made do. Beds & pillows uncomfortable. Expensive night, especially for such a small space. No vending machines available. Snow King Resort (Jackson Hole, Wy)- Lots of activities, ammenities & restaurant were offered here but the room was small. Vending machines were a good distance away from room. We liked this room space least of all. Beds & pillows uncomfortable. Our most expensive lodging. However, we did not take advantage of any of the activities or amenities as we wanted to go to the Tram at the Jackson Hole Resort. Snow King is very close to the town of Jackson Hole. However, for our purposes we probably could have stayed somewhere less expensive or stayed right at the Jackson Hole Resort. The Cody Hotel (Cody, WY) - Our favorite lodging on our trip! Very friendly front desk and custodial service. These people aim to please. Pool, Hot Tub, Steam room, vending machines. Cozy, comfortable room with plenty of space for disability equipment.

1180,"This April, we celebrate Passover, Easter and Ramadan. We also celebrate everyone in the limb loss community. Why? The next amputee could be someone you know. Even you! Every day, more than 500 people in the U.S. lose a limb. It is estimated that, by 2050, the number of people living with limb loss will nearly double. Why are these numbers so high? Most amputations are from diabetes, cancer, trauma, and septic infection. In the last two years as a Certified Peer Visitor, I have worked with 5 people about my own age who were not feeling well, or who lost consciousness due to diabetes and were informed in the ER that they needed an amputation. In the space of just a few hours, their entire lives changed. With the growing number of individuals with limb loss, we must ensure everyone gets access to the necessary resources to reclaim their independence. What do I mean by resources? Sometimes it is something simple, like help with co-pays for physical therapy. Sometimes it is something more complicated like making a home accessible for a new amputee – placing grab bars in the shower, making sure there is room in the bathroom to maneuver with a walker or wheelchair, placing a ramp so one can get into their home. And then there are prosthetics. Even a part of a prosthetic like a knee or an ankle can cost thousands of dollars. Although one may think they have good insurance, the partial payments the patient is responsible for could be thousands of dollars. So, how can you help? Every year I participate in the Adventist 5K Run, Walk and Roll to raise money for the Amputee Patient Assistance Fund. You can participate too.

Here’s an email I wrote Disney and my very recent terrible trip: I went to Disneyland on January 13th, 2019. I got there at 11:15pm but by the time I found parking and used the very limited elevator and long walk to the park it was 1pm. I am disabled and had very hard time. I got there and was told to go to City Hall once I got inside Disneyland and to let them know I was handicap. I did as instructed and was only given a map, an attitude, and no instructions as to what to do with limited mobility and how to do it. My first ride was a disaster. I went to Tomorrowland and tried going in to the buzz light year ride (I believer that’s what it’s called). I was told to park my ACV then was asked if I can transfer (which I replied yes to as long as I’m not standing long). I was standing for what seemed like a lifetime waiting for the staff to let us on the ride (15-20 minutes). My legs were in so much pain and I was sweating from the pain I was in. I then realized the park wasn’t very handicap friendly. I gave the benefit of the doubt and went to the next ride. I was told I can wait in line because my ACV fit fine. Every turn was very difficult I had to keep backing up to turn and people were getting upset and it was embarrassing for my family and I. After going on a few rides we decided to try California adventure and was given an even bigger attitude when I asked if there was any kind of pass ( I was tired of not being able to turn in line as well as feeling so much pain standing in line waiting for my transfer) I explained all this and was was looked up and down and told I will be fine as if they knew what I was feeling physically. I even upgraded to the fast pass to see if it helped but all I did was spend more money for nothing. Overall this was a once in a lifetime vacation being disabled and not able to work which was ruined by rude staff and and completely un-empathetic people. I’m truly disappointed in the lack of accessibility for the disabled. I even had a doctors letter because he was worried I would get slack for being disabled.

I am planning a trip later this year and it will be my very first trip ever since I have become disabled and riding a bariatric sized mobility scooter (Pride Victory 10). I am able to walk short distances, and can stand for short periods of time, but I do get tired quickly doing either. I am a planner by nature, plus this being my first trip where I will need so many things that I never needed before naturally is making me quite nervous! I am single now and will be traveling alone on a very limited budget, so it will be allll up to me to pull this off without a hitch…yikes!! My first question is regarding “accessible hotel rooms”. Is there a standard list/law of items a hotel room must have to be accessible? Or does each different hotel make accessible rooms by what they think some people may need…for example grab bars on a step over tub vs. having a walk/roll in shower? Are they both considered accessible rooms? I have been reading many different posts on AG and learning a lot about tips people use while traveling. There are soooo many things I never even knew to ask about, just to take a vacation to a friends house for a week and back home. There’s no “nice” way to ask this so here I go (I’m not shy ha-ha)….Any tips anyone has for the “beginner traveler” who weighs 305 lbs and rides a bariatric mobility scooter going to Arkansas later this summer???

I think wheelchair users would be able to transfer back and forth to the bed. The short closet was unusable until I was able to move the bundle of extra linens. The grab bars around the toilet were good. The space under the sink worked well for us. The shower was the biggest problem. It actually had a shower curtain that went all the way to the floor (rare) so there was not any flooding. It did not work well for us. I don’t know how someone without help could use it. The shower head was slid up to the top position making it unreachable to anyone seated. The soap and shampoo bottles were on the opposite wall from the shower head and controls. It just didn’t work well. Is this a typical layout for a Holiday Inn Express and Suites?",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

1591,"I am an active middle-aged man who is functionally a quadriplegic due to a neuromuscular disability. Largely due to past difficulties locating a hotel that meets my needs, I haven’t traveled in quite a while. I’m looking for a short getaway within about 300 miles driving distance of my home in New Jersey about 20 miles from Manhattan. The only time I can really do the trip is around the first week of August. By far my biggest accessibility challenge is finding a bed that has underneath for me to use my Hoyer lift. I will be traveling with an attendant and at least one friend, so things like light switch positions are not important. Since I use bed baths and bedpans, bathroom accessibility is really not important either. My wheelchair is fairly big, but still barely within measurement requirements for a standard wheelchair under the Americans with Disabilities Act. I would definitely need to be able to get into my room (and hopefully other public spaces) without stairs, though I may be able to bring a portable ramp if there was an otherwise great option with a step or two. I have my own van, so I don’t need to worry about transportation. Does anyone have any good getaway recommendations for places like Upstate New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, DC, Maryland, or Virginia?

531,"Hi. I just learned this afternoon that there is a website for people with disabilities who wish to visit Disney theme parks so I felt I needed to share this info with this group. I remember my several trips to Disney World after becoming disabled, but it has been quite a few years since I last visited there. Back in that time I and my family (+ 2 adults and 3 kids) never wanted in line at any ride because the cast members would see my mobility scooter and take us right to the front of the line . I understand that changed because perfectly healthy people were using wheelchairs, etc. , to take advantage of their kindness. I do know the cast members went out of their way to accommodate me and my scooter. If I got on a ride that started at one place and ended another, my scooter would be right there waiting on me. It wasn't just me being treated with up frontcare but their 1st question was always, “how many are in your party?” The parks do have wheelchairs for rent but unless it changed they do not reserve them; it is first come, first served. I recommend taking your own or finding a rental place thst will deliver to wherever youare staying. On my first trip as a disabled person, the rental place delivered a scooter to the leading company where we lucked up our key to the house we rented and it included charger plus a large sign on the back of tte scooter with my name so that it was easily identified. We just brought it into tte garage each night and charged it all night for my next day. I never came close to running out of power and we stayed for fireworks a couple of times. There is also a Facebook page that is administered by a young man who is legally blind, and who visits Disney multiple times throughout the year and posts about events, etc., accessible to disabled visitors. I will say there was nothing I wanted to do that was not made accessible. I went on safari , the train, the monorail, etc. Here is the info: disabilityatdisney.com and the FB page is Disability at Disney by Gray Houser.

814,"This post is part of accessibleGO’s “community voices” series, where we spotlight the experiences, insights, and advice of our community—for our community! These posts focus on accessibility and accessible traveling experiences. If you have a post you’d like to submit, let us know by filling out this short form . Meet Heather: My name is Heather Graham, and I live in the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I have always loved to travel and did a fair-bit in my 20s, always backpacking. In the last 15-years I have not done much—a short trip to Vancouver. I went on a cruise some years ago and realized this is the best way for me to travel now. I am so appreciative of my friend going on this cruise and giving me this opportunity to embrace traveling again. I would certainly do more traveling if I had the money and a companion always ready. Having said that, I am booked on a cruise to California in September 2024. Heather’s experience: Our original booking was made by a travel agent, but she dropped us as clients and from then on, we worked strictly with Princess Cruises. I requested from the medical team for a wheelchair accessible vehicle to be at both airports to transfer me. When we arrived in Quebec City there was no wheelchair accessible vehicle there. The cruise personnel who were there to greet guests were pushing me in my wheelchair to a regular bus. When we finally got their attention for me to say I had arranged with their office for wheelchair accessible transportation they wheeled me back inside and started a big conflab with the other employees, of course, this was all in French. Eventually someone asked if I could get into a taxi – which I could transfer myself, so they pushed me over to the taxis. An interesting incident that happened here - again the cruise employees and the taxi drivers got into another big conflab, all in French. When everything seemed settled the cruise employees left and we got into the taxi. Now the taxi driver turned to us and haltingly said, “No English.” It was then we realized that in all this big conflab they had never told him where we were going - where he was taking us. I don't know much French and what I do know is very rusty - my girlfriend was raised in the states, so she doesn't know French at all. He started spewing out words until he said the word for boat which I recognized. I was so excited I said, “yes,” ‘yes,” “yes” instead of “oui,” “oui,” “oui.” When I told my girlfriend (who was looking at me very puzzled) what he had just said she also yelled out “yes,” ‘yes,” “yes” He then said, “Princess bateaux?” And again, we yelled out, “yes,” ‘yes,” “yes.” So, this story ends up on a good note because he drove us straight to the ship! We did have an inside cabin, which I think is often the case when you need an accessible room. I liked it though, because it seemed so quiet, and we never were in there other than that morning or evening. It was bigger than the average size which was great for moving around in the wheelchair. They also had left a lot of room between the two beds which left a wide-open space again for maneuvering in the wheelchair. On board, we quickly noticed that items I had asked for from the medical team were not in our cabin. The medical team had sent me pictures of a stool which would be used in the shower. This was not the case, instead there was an attached seat you just pulled down from the wall, which was a part of the framework in the shower. However, admittedly I liked this much better because it seemed much safer. I suggest checking with your cruise line to see if they have a YouTube video of your cabin to watch beforehand to learn what exactly is in your room and how you would like it set up. This way you can prepare ahead of time. I also asked for what I thought was an M-bar or equivalent which would have helped me to get in and out of bed. The medical team had advised me they did have one, but when we asked our cabin boy about it, he said that was an entirely different item. (Unfortunately, I don't recall now what he said it was.) Again I had previously worked with my physiotherapist by pushing down on the mattress and holding onto the arms of my chair (I use a manual while traveling) to transfer myself. Although I successfully transferred myself, I feel using the M-Bar would certainly be safer. To avoid this situation, the next time I go on a cruise (which I am booked for next September 2024) I will bring my own M-Bar in my luggage. This was one thing I would say as a warning, there seems to be a lot of discrepancies or miscommunication between the ship and the medical team. Again, note my cruise was with Princess Cruises so of course with other cruise lines this may not be the case. When we disembarked in New York City it was a mad-house as 3200 passengers are basically getting off the ship at the same time. A port authority personnel started pushing us again heading towards a bus. This time when we stopped to explain that I had arranged accessible transportation, I believed there was someone waiting in the long line of taxis – and I definitely breathed a sigh of relief that we did not have to join it. My assumption is because as we drew nearer his vehicle, he approached me and asked my name. Of note, both times Princess Cruises did provide us with a voucher for payment. In Charlottetown, PEI we were scheduled on a lighthouse tour that was listed as wheelchair accessible. However, when we arrived at the bus this was not the case. In fact, we were told there was not a wheelchair accessible bus on the island. By this time, I was frustrated enough, so using another skill from my physio, and the railings on either side of the buses entranceway I walked on. At least this time I was able to sit in the front row seats. Our tour guide with most apologetic about the vehicle not being wheelchair accessible and the tour being listed as such. She noted they will have to be more specific about what they mean when they list as wheelchair accessible. If you are pre-booking, there maybe is not much you can do to ascertain it will be wheelchair accessible, but I would check the excursion desk on the ship once you are on board to clarify this point. These may have been some rough spots, but they certainly did not dampen the cruise – I loved it all (and would recommend cruising to others.) I loved the ports, I loved the sea days when we were just on the ship, I loved the food, and I loved the people we met. Regarding the people we met, we made dinner reservations each evening sitting at a table with several other couples so we could get to know those cruising with us. I enjoyed this because when you went about on the ship or even in a port you might see someone you had met and there would be friendly exchanges. We became very friendly with a mother and her daughter who were traveling from Norfolk, England. I will also add that the staff are exceptional at helping in any way they can. When they saw us coming, they would offer their assistance. My friend often said, “No,” but that was her choice. A few times my friend left me alone, and always an employee would approach me and ask if I needed help. They had personnel whose job was to take wheelchair people, and any other person needing assistance on and off the ship. I will take a few minutes to tell you a little bit about our cruise. As previously noted, we flew to Quebec City (from Calgary, Alberta) to board the beautiful Caribbean Princess. Our first stop was the next day when we stopped in Saguenay, Quebec. The next day we sailed down the Saint Lawrence seaway to the Atlantic Ocean stopping first at Charlottetown PEI. After leaving Charlottetown we again had a sea day but that was only because it was very stormy at sea, and we could not dock at Sydney, NS. We sailed on to Halifax for our next port. That evening we crossed into American waters and docked in the morning at Bar Harbor ME. Our final port was Boston MA. And now was the final day at sea before reaching New York City.",child handicap,1,0,1,0,0,0,disputed

820,"Hello! Long story short, I am at a conference at the Westin Hotel in Ottawa. 25% of the conference rooms are only accessible via stairs or a locked elevator that can only be operated by staff at the front desk. If this was communicated to my organization ahead of time, they did not let members know in advance. Moreover, the staff is not responding to elevator requests in a timely manner. Perhaps “timely” is a flippant statement, but we are here for a work event, not for pleasure. Individuals in my group have missed meetings due to these delays. From my understanding of disability law in Canada, this is allowed, as long as it is technically possible to access the space. (I am from the US though, so I'm just reading it off my phone). That said, my friends and I are pissed - I can do stairs, but others in my group cannot. We have petitioned to have this elevator unlocked for the duration of the conference. But is there anything else we can do in the short term, or to encourage this to happen? Buzzwords? A Canadian access law I've overlooked? A secret handshake to do with the manager? A phone number I can call and file a complaint? From what I can tell, they have no safety reason for this elevator to be closed to the public. There are many responsible for this, and I will be contacting them as I can. Looking more for short term solutions. TL;DR - The only elevator to one of the floors requires staff assistance to use.

433,"I read a lot of the comments here and thought it would be good to post something helpful for you all to read. Every year, I take my very elderly father and physically disabled brother and his caretaker on a get away weekend to OC Maryland. Ocean City was always my fathers favorite travel destination since he was a kid and I thought for his birthday, it would be nice to get him away for the weekend. We always bumped it up to early May in hopes for a little bit warmer weather, but Maryland is a very unpredictable weather state. We had 90oF temps in the beginning of the week, but by the time we left on Friday they were predicting highs in lower 50’s. (Not very ideal beach weather!) But we went any how. The first weekend in May is their annual Spring Fest. They close the inlet parking lot and have several circus size tents with hundreds of vendors with crafts and goodies. So let me start by saying we stay at my Aunts condo in OC. It is not labeled as ADA accessible, but since we were very familiar with the layout, we knew what to bring and what was needed. The condo has an elevator, but the location of the condo door is installed (in my opinion) on the wrong side so you have to go past the door and some how back into the door. The railing is very close to the door swing- so no room to turn around. My brother always seems to make it work and can drive his chair better then I can steer a car! Anyhow, back to OC area. The boardwalk Spring fest is extremely wheelchair friendly since it takes place on the pavement. There were scooters, walkers, wheelchair, transport chairs of very type there. Despite the cold temperatures, it was pleasant inside the tent area. We spent several hours there browsing and shopping. The next day we walked the boardwalk. The boardwalk, well, as you can imagine, made from boards… so it was completely manageable for the walker and the electric wheelchair (although very bumpy and we had to keep adjusting his phone that he keeps on his lap) . There were several souvenir shops that we not accessible at all because they either had a step or two to get up or they had so much merchandise that going in would have taken out several displays and then there were the ones that appeared wide isles until you got deeper into the shop only to find we were trapped by displays that had breakable merchandise on it and isles that were too narrow to go any farther. Again, luckily for my brother, he is the king of “reverse” and managed to get unstuck without taking out any displays! We also visited Rohobeth in Delaware on this trip and found the same issues. **Side note, the municipal parking lots in OC, MD don’t care if you have a handicap tag on it or not, they make you pay no matter what in OC. Rohobeth was free parking until May 14th We did enjoy several new restaurants this visit. In the past we found a lot of the restaurants with Picnic style tables (no wheelchair tables available) and not friendly for a 80+ year old to climb in to enjoy his meal. This year, we hit 100% on restaurants, so much so that I wan to give them a shout out. First night we ate at “Coin’s”. This was a local favorite that has been open for a long time in OC Maryland located near the boardwalk. They had tables and booths and a few hi tops. The tables were spaced nicely apart that we did not feel like we were blocking any of the staff or patrons. We actually hit it during Happy hour and we all had more food then we were able to eat. The second night we tried a newly renovated place (that took over an old favorite in OC - so it was an older building as well) This place was called Route 66 diner. The modifications were perfect. We sat in a very spacious area and had a wonderful waiter named Ace. He made our dining experience really nice. Although this restaurant does not allow substitutions, the amount of food and flavor was exceptional. The food came out hot and was a pleasure to eat after a very cold rainy day on the boardwalk. So if you have food restrictions (like I do) then be aware this may not be the best place for you. The last day we tried a restaurant that we passed many times in the past, but never stopped. This was the Cottage Cafe. They always looked busy, so we figured it was a good sign. Again, we were pleased to find a restaurant that was not picnic style tables. This place was probably the fanciest place we ate and the menu ranged in price all over the board from reasonable to extremely expensive. But out of the 3 restaurants the bill here was the cheapest! I enjoyed a beautiful crab cake and my brother had a crab pizza. My dad ate his gigantic fish sandwich and our caretaker had the special meatloaf and proclaimed it was the best meatloaf he ever ate. Now the weather kept us from going on the beach (which was fine by me, there is so much to do during the day that just viewing the beach from the boardwalk was good for me.) But if you were to come down during life guard season (memorial day to Labor day) They have free access to wheelchair sand chairs. You just need to leave someones drivers license while you have the chair. You can keep the chair with you while on the beach, but if someone comes and needs it as well, they will come find you on the beach and ask you to transfer so that some one else can use it to come down. Sometimes this causes an issue with trying to locate it when you need it to go back. They ask you to stay on the street that you used the chair from. This is not an issue for us because the wheelchair beach access is only one block from my aunts condo. They have tried some of those new mats that go over the sand at OC, but I believe they failed because the sand is very fine there and blows across the mats and covers them in no time. Know also that the water is extremely rough there and that even experienced swimmers can easily get into trouble quickly (my daughter, who is an excellent swimmer got pulled out in a rip tide one summer right before my eyes- very scary to witness and luckily her cousin was close enough and grabbed her out of the rip to grab her and pull her to safety). Overall, we enjoyed our off season trip to Ocean City Maryland and recommend it with some planning.",child handicap,1,0,1,0,0,0,disputed

424,"My wife and I are in the process of planning a trip to San Diego, CA, from Raleigh, NC, to visit our daughter and her husband in San Diego. Additionally, we are planning a side trip to visit a couple of National Parks, Kings Canyon and Sequoia, which we have not visited before. Planning a trip, especially those requiring air travel and visiting new places always causes some anxiety, because when traveling with special needs you are never quite sure of what you might find. My wife has secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and is no longer able to do any of the activities of daily living without assistance. She is also wheelchair bound. Especially since Covid19 it has become more difficult to arrange accessible travel. Traveling with a lot of medical equipment by air is also stressful. Making reservations in advance and checking them repeatedly is essential, both for transportation and lodging. When booking airline tickets I always ask for accessible seating and make sure we get it. It is not acceptable to be put in a seat where you cannot move and people have to climb over you to get to the restroom. Getting a wheelchair accessible room with a roll-in shower is also absolutely necessary for us. I typically make sure I have a written guarantee that the room is reserved for us and that it has all the features we need. If I have any doubt I request photos of the room and shower. Unfortunately, even with this level of preparation we have arrived at hotels (e.g., TownePlace Suites San Diego Airport/Liberty Station) and been told that the guaranteed room is not available. This trip we are going to a different hotel and hope to have a better experience. Visiting the National Parks can be extremely rewarding but here again one has to make sure that the lodging you are getting will meet your needs. On this trip we need to stay an hour’s drive outside the park to get the necessary accommodation. When visiting the parks it is a good idea to go to the park website and check on accessible activities and if necessary to call and talk with the rangers to find out about accessible activities and facilities (family accessible restrooms and accessible guided tours). Again the more preparation you do the better the experience is likely to be. Many of the National Parks now offer wheelchair accessible trails and activities. While visiting our daughter and husband in San Diego, unfortunately, we need to stay in a hotel, because their house is small and not adequately accessible for us to be there overnight. However, since we travel to see her at least annually, we have left some equipment and other items with them to lighten the load of things we have to fly with. When we arrive in San Diego we rent a car (usually a SUV or Minivan) large enough to accommodate the wheelchair, the two of us, and additional baggage. Fortunately I am able to transfer my wife from her wheelchair to a passenger seat in most SUVs or minivans. Calling ahead to restaurants, entertainment, and other places of interest is also a good idea. We like to go to museums and I usually call ahead to make sure they have an accessible restroom available. Sometimes this requires our using a staff restroom because the general restrooms are not family accessible and my wife needs assistance in the restroom. It is a good idea to go over all of your special needs and check that they can be accommodated at the places you are interested in visiting.",child handicap,1,0,1,1,0,0,disputed

Background for understanding, and while I would love for the world to be fully accessible to me, the reality is, it never will be. Especially when you love history, and cringe at newness. 😁 Instead of planning specific trips, I tend to go for the least expensive airplane ticket, wherever that might lead to, and plan from there. So my first trip as disjointed as it sounds, landing in Milan, Italy, overnight train trip to Marseilles, France because I've always wanted to see it. Back to Milan, short flight to Bari. Stay for a few nights, take the ferry to Dubrovnik, flight to Plovdiv for the history and to stay with friends, then to Ljubljana, flight to Zagreb and train through Austria and Northern Italy, then back to Milan. I work full-time in healthcare and despite how stressful my work is, I love the vacation time. ❤️ All of this is fluid, I do already have a flex ticket for the ferry and flights into and out of Milan three-ish+ weeks apart.

If I had needed a lift, it would have fit under the bed. The bathroom with the exception of the shower was easily accessible. The shower was in a tub, but the tub height did allow me to slide from my chair to the edge of the tub where I could use the handheld shower and bathe. The downside, the coffee table in front of the couch made it difficult to maneuver but the staff moved it for me. The free breakfast was so-so but there were scrambled eggs and sausage.

1231,"I’m going on a bit of an extended, multi-destination (Caribbean and South America) trip and am trying to figure out how best to insure it. My understanding is that as long as it’s declared ahead of time, SCI is covered as a pre-existing condition. Can anyone confirm this? Is there anything out of the ordinary that needs to happen in order to declare/document it? My other concern is for my chair. I""ll be bringing my super-old backup/travel chair. It cost $8000 20 years ago but probably isn’t worth $100 today… except for to me it is… the fact that it’s still a chair light enough for me to lift into my car on my own makes it VERY valuable to me. I don’t even know how I would go about replacing it if it were lost or damaged beyond repair. And a new wheelchair light enough for m to be able to load into my car by myself would likely still run several thousand dollars today. Any tips for making sure this is somehow covered? I know my primary chair (1$k brand new) is covered under my renter’s insurance, which I believe covers it from damage during travel. Should i add the backup chair to the policy as well? I’m kind of getting the feeling I’ll be screwed if something happens to this backup chair just because of it depreciated value “on paper”. I’m at a bit of a loss here.

189,"Last week we flew from Milan to Madrid. We used Air Europa. It is a more budget airline but it has business class seating. Most budget airlines don’t. Checking in was pretty easy. The attendant asked the normal questions about battery size and could we remove them for the flight. It was not the long drawn out process we normally go through. I do walk the few steps from the door to my seat in front. My husband folded the chair, removed the batteries, and readied the chair for pick up. I made it very clear I needed the chair at the door to disembark. Wonders never cease. Our plane stopped on the tarmac and stairs were wheeled to it to disembark. The flight attendant gestured for me to just wait. I was getting antsy but had no choice but to wait. The staff was very patient. They had a truck with a lift on it drive up to the plane and my chair was on it. Another lady was there and had an airport chair waiting. They strapped us in and drove us to the entrance and lowered us down. Perfect. Another person met us at the door and took us to the baggage claim and then to the taxi stand. There are other ways to get into the city but with the chair and luggage we opted for the fixed price taxi. It cost $33 Euros and worth every penny. We stayed at the Toc Hostal near Placa Del Sol. They had double rooms as well as bunk rooms. It is in the very heart of everything. We saw the New Year at the Sol with the rest of Spain. I will warn that while the staff at the Toc Hostal were very helpful their definition of wheelchair accessible is a bit looser than mine. The sidewalk in front is very narrow. They laid down ramps for me to get in and out but I always had to walk a few steps to get inside. The staff always ran over to make sure I was in safely. They said they would talk to the owner about fixing the ramp. We didn’t use the buses as we found the places we wanted to see were walkable. Yes there are some cobblestones. But the beauty of the architecture and the warmth of the people outweighed any down sides. It was January but we found eating outside was possible and did it often. Since a lot of the older places have a step or many to enter this helped us. We visited the Prado Museum. It was a great art gallery. It was crowded and I mostly saw butts all day not artwork. It was frustrating. We went to a smaller museum the Lazaro Galdiano Museum on Carrer de Serrano. It was a hike but worth it. They had good accessibility. No tour groups standing in front of the artwork. An elevator for other floors was small but did it’s job. They also have lots of other goods to see, furniture, housewares, jewelry, armor, swords, etc. We took the subway to the Atocha station from placa del Sol early in the morning. We walked it the day before and found the route was very steep. The metro took us right to the station and was easy to use. Alas Madrid is over and the train (Iryo) whisked us off to Barcelona in under 3 hours. Our first train trip that was actually on time.

46,"So we have left Nashville for Asheville so I I thought I would send a few updates. First, Hilton Garden Inn in Nashville. The room was great, big enough to move around in my power chair in both the bedroom and bathroom. Pull down seat in the accessible shower. The accessible rooms are also the first room as you get off the elevator, not the usual long hall trek. Despite the location, we did not hear people chatting as they waited for the elevator. So kudos on the sound proofing too. I have already posted about how high the bed, towel racks, amenities were. Upon checking out, Greg at the front desk shared that a guest who stayed in the accessible room one floor above me complained the bed was too low! So, should you be staying at this hotel and need the lower bed, ask for 416, higher bed, 316. I know it is confusing, shouldn’t higher bed be on the higher floor? Other tidbits. Do not go anywhere in Nashville on a Tuesday. No concerts at the Ryman on Tuesday. The General Jackson cruise on the Cumberland River is only offered at mid-day, no evening dinner cruise. No music in most off the off-Broadway locations. We were also unable to tour the gardens at the Opryland Gaylord. There is some major construction going on, and we were unable to gain access to the garden areas. Do go to Nashville on the first Wednesday of the month, many museums are free. We went to the National Museum of African American Music was terrific! There is a nice big chairlift from the entrance to museum level. The staff was young, helpful and friendly. There is an unmarked family bathroom between the men’s and ladies’ rooms that is nice and large. Most of all the museum was well thought out, educational and lots of fun.

52,"It appears that Hilton Garden Inn no longer includes a complimentary breakfast with their room rates. Especially surprising because that is what we were offered when we booked our rooms. Moving on, we have spent the last two days getting to know Nashville. Here are things that we learned. 1) You absolutely need to wear earplugs when you walk along Broadway Street, where many of the country bars are located. The bands have their sound system amped way up so that people on the street will be lured in to buy beer by the bucket. If there is no room to go inside, you may still listen out on the sidewalk with your bucket. Each place seems to compete to see which has the loudest sound system. Many of the cars, tour buses, trolleys, pedal bars, and other vehicles have sound systems that are equally loud. 2) Many of the Grey Line Tours are wheelchair-friendly, so long as there is enough room on the bus. We took the one-hour city tour just to get the lay of the land. The double-decker bus had a portable ramp. I was not able to go up to the top deck, but I was just as happy in the air conditioning on the first level and heard the tour leader just fine. Other tours use smaller buses and you do need to reserve in advance. 3) Printers Alley, which is quite near the convention center and Broadway, offers much quieter bars/restaurants that feature blues and jazz. Getting a recommendation on which place to go to is a little harder. 4) Opryland, the Cumberland River cruises, and the Gaylord Opryland are a 20-minute drive from Nashville. We will explore there later this week. 5) The architecture of Nashville is really interesting from the historic buildings of the 1800s to the “Batman building.” It is really the ATT headquarters.

The chair stopped working this morning and required phone calls with two different techs to get it started. We still have to push various buttons and send a little prayer to heaven, but so far it is working. We left about 4:30 pm yesterday and, after enduring torrential rains, arrived at the Hampton Inn in Charleston, WV, a little after midnight. What a great accessible room. There was plenty of room to move around in both the bedroom and bathroom. There was a fold-down chair in the roll-in shower, and drawers that pulled out from the bathroom counter, allowing you to place your toiletries on a lower level. Had the toiletries, which are attached to the walls, been at a level a person in a wheelchair could reach, everything would have been perfect. Here we are at day 2, after a really nice drive to Louisville, KY. We are at the Embassy Suites East, near my family. Let us just say that the Hampton Inn has a few things to teach its sister hotel. There is one phone in the two-room suite. It is on a corner table near the wall. It is impossible to reach in a wheelchair. The phone jack on the wall by the desk does not work. We settled for a long cord that may trip anyone trying to get to the sofa. The bathroom and roll-in shower are not as large as it was at the Hampton Inn. The bed is much too high to transfer to, though people who need a Hoyer lift will be happy. Requests for a shower chair, a solution to the phone problem, and folks to remove the box springs or the bed frame took way too long for a staff response.

448,"There are other posts about both subjects but I couldn’t figure out how to post. Here is recent information, from March/April 2024 Traveled on 1-95 south from NC to Port Canaveral, FL for a cruise. Stayed in Avid hotel (part of IHG hotel group) in Savannah on Gateway Dr near airport. Good bed and Hoyer accessible. May be that Avid hotels and IHG hotel group have more rooms with open bed frames. I had to call 10 hotels in Savannah to find one and this is only because one of the agents researched it for me. Hotel had roll in shower and tub room arrangements. Not important for us since my wife does not use shower or toilet. Also had decent Grab and Go breakfast. Easy access from highway. I always confirm by calling the hotel, which is what Patch does if you book a room through her. In Cocoa Beach, FL, which is the closest to Port Canaveral, we had similar success at the Holiday Inn Express (also IHG hotel group). They also have open bed frames. Actually, only 1 room on the 1st floor was ADA and was taken. Plus the elevator was broken. So Ryan, front desk clerk, who uses crutches and has a neuromuscular issue and understands accessibility, actually modified a room for us on the first floor. They took out one bed entirely and moved the remaining bed from a closed pedestal to an open frame for us. Wow! Plus the included breakfast was decent. Bed height is not so much an issue for us since my wife’s Permobil chair has an elevation function. We cruised on Royal Caribbean’s Wonder of the Seas. It is a very large ship and that can be an issue for some. But it also has very accessible common areas. We booked through Debra Kerper, via Patch’s recommendation and she helped us obtain a junior ADA suite. It was huge and had built in ramps for the veranda, a roll in shower and a queen bed. Very functional and spacious. We also took the Hoyer on board. No issues getting on, but leaving was trouble, due to regulations. We had 3 different porters. One from room to gangway, one from the ship to the terminal, one from the terminal to the parking lot. Tips came in handy, but we were able to keep all our luggage and the Hoyer lift with us. Port Canaveral parking is free for modified vans and FL disabled veterans license plates, but not for regular hang tags. Hope this is helpful for someone.",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

First, we were given a room that we quite far from the elevators which meant we had to drive down long, narrow hallways to get to our room. The problem was that the cleaning carts were in the hallways almost constantly. He was not able to go anywhere by himself. Secondly, the trying to get from floor to floor was an issue because he can’t navigate quickly enough to beat the crowds to the elevators. Finally, we booked a tour to see Mendenhall Glacier through the cruise line.

The Department now calls this rule “unnecessary” and burdensome.” Removing this rule would: Eliminate enforceable accessibility standards for new federally funded buildings. Allow renovations that leave out ramps, elevators, accessible restrooms, and more. Undermine the civil rights protections of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

In preparation for resuming travel, we bought a MAJESTIC IQ-7000 Remote Controlled Electric Wheelchair with the automatic folding option last June, and while it’s a really comfortable ride for my husband, I’m the one who has to get it in and out of the back of our SUV. And since it weighs 57 lbs. without the battery, I can’t lift it by myself. After trying several different options – trailer with ramp (too heavy for me to maneuver), then ramps (again, too heavy for me to maneuver), then I spent $1,100 for a Go-Lite Portable Mini Lift, but it is still cumbersome and difficult to get the collapsed wheelchair onto it because when the lift is fully collapsed, it is still 9 inches off the ground. My husband is unable to help me so it’s all up to me. I’m 72 and not very strong. So we made the decision recently to try to sell the wheelchair & lift and buy a lightweight scooter that comes apart into 4-5 sections with the heaviest section being no more than 30-34 lbs. That much I can lift by myself. We’ve identified a few models that fit the bill, but we must sell the wheelchair and lift, and try to get maximum dollar to put towards the scooter.

I’ve been putting it off for so long, always for one reason or another (and, with COVID!, sometimes very legitimate reason)—but this year I am DOING it.Anybody else planning to make a travel dream come true in 2023?teach10095 says: “My husband and I are planning on going to Alaska at the end of this August. We were on an Alaskan cruise about fourteen years ago and last year did a land and sea package. This year we are renting a car and going to some places we still have not been to and spend about 7-10 days just in Homer.”Jstorky1 adds: “We have been to Alaska several times using scooters and it never gets old. The cruise ships make it easy to see Alaska and most of the stops have piers that are easy to get on and off without stairs or tender boats.”Check out hotels in Homer, AK here.﻿ ﻿ We have more than a few members headed to Alaska! | Martina Birnbaum Disneyland Adventure!﻿ ﻿ The magic of Disney | FrozenShutter hita1lopez is planning on bringing her daughter to Disneyland for the first time. “Ours is to one day take our beautiful Autistic girl to her dream world - Disneyland!!!

ETECH Mobility met him, showed him what they had, threw in a couple of free upgrades at less then half the cost of my old chair. It has twice the power, has never run out after hours of wandering the cities. If mine ever breaks again I’m going to go back there and get another. We stayed in the Z Hotel Covent Garden. A reasonably priced hotel in the heart of the city. We have booked to spend our last couple of nights there in January. Small room but great bathroom. Our best train experience so far has been on the Eurostar from London to Brussels and then on another Eurostar train to Cologne. It was organized, with someone to lead me to where I had to go, go me on the lift to the train, met me in Brussels and got me on the next train. seamless.

210,"Krakow, Poland has been on our list of places to visit for a long time. I researched the heck out of it for over a year. The historic center is fairly small and easy to manage. We have been to Gdansk before and found the Polish people to be very nice and happy. So off we went with high expectations. Krakow is beautiful. It is more reasonably priced than many European cities. Now to the reality for wheelchair bound travelers… Krakow is not set up for wheelchairs. Despite all the research and assurances we found it impossible. When we needed something in a store my husband had to go in and buy it while I sat out in the cold waiting. Almost every store, restaurant, and museum had steps going inside of it. We went up the steep hill to the castle as I was assured it was wheelchair accessible. It might have been but the entire wc entrance was closed for construction. That evening we walked all over trying to find a place to eat dinner. We found 1. We ate dinner and then discussed our options. We stayed at the Campanile Hotel. It was very adequate. All except the absence of a curb cut in front of the hotel to reach it. But we could live with going the long way around every day. Clean, reasonably priced and accessible. They agreed to letting us out of our reservation for a one day charge. My husband ran to the train station to get tickets out the next day. He bought tickets to Vienna. So we pack back up and leave Krakow after three nights. At the train station we are informed it is impossible for me to get on the train with the tickets they sold us (mu husband knows to specify wheelchair access). I had to get out of the chair, climb 3 hard steps into the train, but we boarded. I can now also vouch for the crappy 2nd class seats on the Czech train. Luckily it was a direct train so no making a connection. I can recommend Krakow for the people and the beauty but I can not say it was okay for wheelchairs.",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

67,"From a member of our community: Before we go on our next cruise, I wanted to get some advice about cruise excursions. We normally go on Royal Caribbean or Norwegian. With Norwegian we've normally gone out of New York. The cruise ships have no idea at all what the accessibility is on excursions at their ports. The last cruise, we were at Bermuda. Nobody could tell us how far it was to walk to the beach, if we could go on the glass bottom boat with a scooter, if the boat had steps and if it had steps, a railing? Absolutely nobody from The Cruise line knew. My husband and I would like to enjoy some excursions but without knowing what we're dealing with beforehand, it's just not doable. I would love to go back to Bermuda. I was always a beachgoer but can no longer walk on the sand due to a neuromuscular disease. I didn't even know if I could get on a tram or walk to the beach which would be the highlight of my trip. So, I would like to know about Bermuda excursions but also about other cruise ships, mostly Norwegian and Royal Caribbean because they are most affordable for us. I’d also welcome recommendations for accessible hotels in the Florida keys where they actually have pool that's easy to get into and out of and that isn't a far walk so I don't have to get a scooter? thank you so much!",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

228,"I am a Travel Agent who specializes in cruises. I have stayed in many Homewood Suites but this, by far, is the worst experience I have ever had. I have mobility issues and reserved an ADA accessible stateroom with roll in shower. Check in time was 3:00pm. We arrived at 4:30pm and our room was not ready. The wait was 30 minutes but knowing that on a Sunday the hotel is full with cruise passengers getting to the cruise port, we understood. We received our keys and then went to the elevator. I use two canes for walking and although I can walk I can only walk short distances. We went to the second floor heading to Room 227. We walked and walked and walked. My back was screaming at me and I had to stop to give it a rest. When we reached our room I could not believe the absolutely ridiculous lay out. This was a studio suite. It was quite large and could easily accommodate a wheelchair or scooter. There was a love seat with a coffee table that faced the bed from one end of the room but no TV. The TV was on a wall facing the bed. Therefore, I could not sit in a comfortable sofa but moved a hard chair over to the bed area to watch TV. There was no room at the bed end to place a comfortable chair. We discovered an elevator closer to the room (the room was at the rear of this large building). When we down to the first floor from that elevator the door outside had a curb. Therefore, someone in a wheelchair could not use that door. There was no ramp. I can only imagine the fear for a person in a wheelchair staying in this room in the event of a fire. When I spoke with the Manager she told me that the King Bed Accessible Suites were all at the back of the building and there were 3 or 4 on each floor. If you had a two Queen bed room, there were a couple closer to the main lobby. I would not stay there again nor would I ever consider booking a client with mobility issues into this hotel",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

88,"Hi, my husband, and I would live to travel more. But find it very difficult when motels, say they have handicap rooms. And their beds are all closed in around the bottom of the bed. The reason is my husband is a quad and uses a portable lift to transfer him into the bed. which requires open area under the bed so the lift can roll under the bed for the transfer. I always have to call the motels in the area of where we choose to stay and ask them this question, does your handicap room have a bed on legs? You will be surprised how many motels say no.

1020,"My hubby suffered an aortic dissection December 2018 and is considered a “2%’er” for 98% of those afflicted with acute dissection don’t make it to the hospital much less through lengthy surgeries, hospital stays and comorbidities like his kidneys failing and brain damage from extended lack of bloodflow to both. He has a 5# lift/push/pull limitation for life - meaning, even when his mobility is lessened due to various situations like gout flares or venous insufficiency - he can’t use a cane, walker or manual wheelchair. He can’t drive, can’t climb stairs, can’t pull himself in/out of beds. So countless times we arrive somewhere to find a long stair passage we didn’t expect or dangerous bathtubs and - most recently at a resort in Pensacola, FL - the beds were so high neither of us could get in them. So the maintenance staff had the bright idea to remove the box springs while we were out to dinner. Hubby could sit on and collapse into the pillowtop mattress, and it was heartbreaking watching him try to figure out how to get out because the wood bedframe wouldn’t let him after he’d sunken into the mattress. Imagine our dismay as he’d taken his diuretic calling for multiple bathroom trips overnight, so urinal/catheter was our only option except for the times I hoisted him myself from behind, giving him a butt-boost while assuring his arms were crossed over his chest and he didn’t try to lift/pull his body weight out. Booking cruises is challenging for we’ve learned we can’t book most river cruises for there’s no dedicated dock and they often raft up 2-5 in a row away from the dock so passengers have to step down/up into multiple boats to get ashore or back to your river cruiser. Ocean cruises that have excursions may tender into ports and even though we ask about it, we find we can’t get in/out or safely travel on the small tenders ashore. We’ve figured out how to handle the mandatory muster sessions, etc. Depending on tides, the steep ramps are treacherous and trying to get staff to make the wheelchair lift accessible to someone who is not in a wheelchair is not easy. Booking flights we have to ensure we don’t load or unload on the tarmac with steep metal stairs/ramp, and we always use credit card-earned miles to fly Business or 1st Class for he can’t tolerate most of the coach seating situations. I want us to live til we die and create memories while we can. But planning/booking travel so he can get the most enjoyment out of it is very difficult…again - especially because his disabilities are mostly not visible. But add his cognitive deficits to his physical limitations and it can be exhausting. He loves the outdoors - hiking, etc, and I hope this site will help us in myriad ways.

There is plenty of turning radius in the bathroom and living space. Although there was carpet, my husband said it was easy to roll over. The elevators were frequent and the location on the Strip was great. The hotel is connected to the Bellagio which has a free accessible tram to Park MGM. There is no tram through NY NY, but it does pick back up at Excalibur and goes down to Mandalay Bay. We saw Michael Jackson One performed by Cirque Du Soleil at the Mandalay Bay. We purchased accessible seats and they gave my husband the option to transfer into a rotating chair or to stay in his. They stored his wheelchair and brought it before the show ended. Since it was winter, we did not check out the pool, gym or spa. This is only a review for Alex’s rental.

630,"New Member Introduction I am happy to be a newbie in this community! My name is Georgette. I am a retired teacher of 32 years. My husband of 46 years retired in 2019. We built a new retirement home and moved to Delaware in January of 2020…right before the pandemic. My health issues are varied: polymyalgia rheumatica, lymphedema, lipodema, diabetes type 2, COPD, hypertension, and obesity. All of them contribute to my limited mobility. My biggest problem is trying to travel with my husband without putting too much on him. He is a very supportive care giver for me at home. We have gone on several cruises before the pandemic. However, my mobility has worsened since then. So when we took a Disney Cruise a few weeks before Christmas with my daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren, the reality of my ability to travel and enjoy it, really came into focus. We thought we had all of our bases covered: We contacted Disney’s disability service and planned for all we could think of); ordered a scooter to be at the dock; flew first class to Orlando the day before embarking; stayed in a handicapped room in the hotel in the airport (really great hotel), signed up for the Disney bus with lift to take us to the port. (We were told I could use the lift with a walker. But this was not true.) What were the challenges of our trip? Our first challenge was planning for the trip… airplane, hotel, disability needs, etc. The second challenge was figuring out how to pack all the equipment that we needed to bring: 2 c-paps, portable walker, compression machine and compression boots. The third challenge was packing everything in the least amount of suitcases. What ruined our trip? The scooter we ordered had a malfunctioning battery. It seemed fine until we began going up the ramp to the ship. The scooter was always on yellow or red no matter how much we charged the battery! Needless to say, I was unable to attend most events on the ship and was unable to visit Nassau. When we did try to venture out, my husband tried using this huge wheelchair that hardly fit going through the hallways! He was exhausted from tending to my needs. I couldn’t get into bed without his help and I needed help in getting up from the couch in our room. The final straw was that a wheelchair assistant who didn’t want to take me in the airport ended up ramming my knee into a line pole in the TSA line! So, my husband is feeling we shouldn’t plan any more cruises. Thank you so much for reading this long post and allowing me to vent. I welcome any suggestions, support, and helpful feedback that you may have.",child handicap,1,0,1,0,0,0,disputed

I ask the person to measure the height from the floor to make sure the wheels slide under. Two different people assured me the ADA room met my specification and both measured the space under the bed at 6”. We got there and EVERY SINGLE ROOM IN THE HOTEL HAS A PLATFORM BED. After escalating my complaint 3 times and hearing: “We’ve never had this request before! It’s a unique need.” We did get reasonable compensation. The good: Everything else about the room was perfect for us My husband’s chair has a lift feature and the bed top was between the lowest and highest settings so he was able to slide board down both getting in and out of bed. Key card allowed both manual and automatic open and the door opened fully for for a long time. Low and high peep hole Room for wheelchair to move around. End tables that I could move to a better position so they were out of way for slide board transfer.

Our friends suggested we take the train (Great Western Rail) from Paddington Station to our destination, and it would be eminently affordable. It was. However, having traveled in both France and Italy by train (prior to my amputation) I thought it would be a nightmare. I did some online research before the trip and discovered that the British have instituted an incredible infrastructure to assist mobility challenged people to get from the curb on the street to one’s seat on the train seamlessly! How it worked: I made a reservation and purchased our train tickets (and selected our seats). Then I made an online reservation with their FREE TRAVEL ASSIST service. In their words: “Passenger Assist allows you to request an assistance booking in advance . Any train company can organize assistance for your entire journey, even if you are travelling on multiple services. Passenger Assist includes: offering a helping hand to navigate the station (even offering a golf cart and driver from the taxi stand outside) help getting on or off the train meeting you from your train and taking you to your next train or the exit arranging a ramp on or off your train assistance relating to a non-visible impairment carrying your bag(s) – up to 3 items of luggage as per the National Rail Conditions of Travel ” We arrived by taxi and there was a glass enclosed Passenger Assist waiting area, clearly marked, right at the taxi drop off point, I use a rollator, and we had one bag. We entered, identified ourselves and checked in. Moments later a golf cart-like vehicle arrived (they call it a “buggy”) and they transported us up and down ramps, across the huge station, through special access gates right to our train car; helped me onto the train and to my seat; loaded our luggage; folded my rollator and POOF…done. When we arrived at Chippenham Station out in the countryside, we were met and off-loaded and assisted all the way to our friend’s vehicle in the car park. Same service returning!

1026,"In response to the posting about Hampton Inns (owned by the Hilton organization), my husband and I just came back from an extensive (16 day) road trip to San Francisco and LA, staying in 7 hotels. The two Hilton hotels (both Hilton Garden) were the most disappointing, in terms of their accessibility “amenities.” My husband is in a power WC and requires two minimum items: a toilet he can transfer to and from and a firm bed. Neither of the Hilton hotels had a raised toilet. Although we had a seat extender with us, it would not fit because both toilets were also oval. So my husband had to go down to the disabled restroom in the lobbies, which happened to be round, with his boxed extender, in order to use the toilet. I doubt if we will stay at a Hilton hotel again. The other hotels were Holiday Inn Express, which met the requirements, and the Renaissance Inn at the LA Airport, which was superlative. One other issue, which is almost a requirement, is that there needs to be enough space on both sides of the bed so that my husband can easily transfer to and from the WC to the bed. Unfortunately, the second Holiday Inn Express (in Eugene, OR) did not provide that. So, to sum it up, yes, much more needs to be done re accessibility in hotels. We spent a lot of money for less than adequate service. I think only a public raising of awareness of this lack will lead to any improvement.

1809,"Flying with a power chair is probably one of the stressful events you will ever experience. I know because I have been doing it for over 25 years and it does not get any easier. But until they can send me up in a rocket to wherever I have to go, the airlines and I are stuck with each other. What else can I do? Stay home? On the other hand, with a root canal they put to sleep during the whole time, nobody cares about your shoes and you don’t have to worry about missing connecting root canals. Do’s and don’t of flying: Top rule: Don’t do it! Taking the train or bus is so much more relaxing when your chair is always with you. But, if you insist. When you check-in, tell them the combined weight of you and your chair and suggest that you wheel right up to the cabin door. Trust m`e, nobody wants to push 430 pounds through a busy airport. If you want someone to escort you to get you to the gate, ask. Personally, I find they just slow me down. At the gate, show the crew how to engage and disengage the brakes on both sides if applicable. Tell them to engage the brake the while in flight. Insist that your joystick and footrests be removed and taken on board. If not, tell them these parts are extremely fragile and tell them they WILL be damaged if not. If necessary, emphasize that this is a highly specialized piece of equipment and personalized to meet your unique needs. It cannot be rented and the local wheelchair dealer is likely closed or don’t stock the parts. Your vacation will over before it starts. DO TRY REMOVING THE PARTS AT HOME FIRST! There is no time for surprises just before your flight. Remove any ties keeping cords in place. It very hard to cut ties when the sharpest object the crew, including the pilot, has is a car key. If you need some, bring some spares. I have never had to resort to this, but if they refuse to cooperate, tell them you’re not getting on that plane and to take your luggage off the plane because it has essential items. See how fast they change their minds. If you have dry-cell batteries, there is no need to remove them. When the joystick is disconnected, there is no live circuit. Reinstalling the batteries can be problematic. I have a 100% survival rate when my batteries are left intact Make clear that your chair shall not be put on its side when being loaded. If they ask why not, ask them what do you they think would happen is they flipped their car on its side. If your chair is damaged, go to Customer Service and file a damage claim. There is a central agency. Scootaround, that handles claims for over 30 airlines. I have never had a claim disputed.

1678,"Hi everyone, It’s Pinky; one of your Forum Moderators. Welcome to my long awaited New Pinky’s Accessible Adventures Diary Series (P.A.A.D.); a new feature here on the Forum. Each week I will be focusing on a single day’s worth of accessible activities, lodging and travel from one of our exploratory trips to the Caribbean. It is my hope that through what we have learned, we can help others plan their own adventures. I am not your typical traveler when it comes to following “the rules” about what we’ve been told we can do and not do when it comes to traveling in a wheelchair. When I first became disabled and decided to return to traveling, I was never satisfied with the fact that in the few places with official accessible excursions; we were typically remanded to boring bus or ferry tours, where all I could do was sit there and just watch this exotic land zip by me in blur of tropical colors. That wasn’t enough for me and I was sure there was more out there for us in the Caribbean to participate in; I just needed to do some of my own homework before arriving to ensure a fantasy vacation for everyone, including myself. But what good is just keeping all this information to myself, when I know there are others out there who have hesitated taking that trip to a Caribbean island because of the same fear of boredom? Although I spend an extended amount of time in St. Maarten/St. Martin, every year, I just got back from another Dutch Caribbean vacation that blew me away and I had to start with that island (we will get back to St. Maarten/St. Martin next trip review). Accessible Curacao Overhead Curacao Beach Day 1 I wasn’t sure at first if it was going to be important to share with you the flying portion of this trip, as I usually have a very smooth trip when I fly directly from Newark to St. Maarten; however this time I had to fly through Miami on a different airline and based on what happened; I needed to share so you can prepare yourself for this possibility. In case you didn’t know already, most flights to the Caribbean go out of Miami or the New York City Area; so if you plan to fly from anywhere else in the country, be prepared for a stop along the way. It pains me to have to speak negatively about the Miami Airport because I grew up there and it was my favorite airport as a child; but if you have flown there in the last decade, then you know how overcrowded and understaffed it has become for the size crowd flying through there. This isn’t meant to scare you, but you need to be prepared, especially if your a chair user or traveling with anyone with disabilities. Miami International AirportTypically you set up with your airline any specialized specific needs you may have for traveling and then they arrange with a 3rd-party company in each of the airports you are traveling through to provide those requested services. Now if you have checked your wheelchair for the flights, be prepared that they may just take it to the next plane for you and provide you with inter-airport wheelchair transportation instead. This is the one airport I am going to tell you “NOT” to do it that way. Instead, tell the gate agent at your original departure check-in that you would like your chair brought to you in Miami and you re-check it in for your next flight. Otherwise you will have a nightmare experience with the 3rd party wheelchair company in the Miami Airport and could risk missing your connecting flight…trust me on this one (too long a story to explain). Plus, on your way home you will want your own chair as you will have to first go through customs, immigration and re-check in with ticketing and TSA before being able to get on your connecting flight(s) home (the whole time at the mercy of being pushed around in that horrific airport transfer chair). Once on the connecting flight to your island; just kick back and relax because they always seem to take great care of you on the islands in the airports. JetBlue now has Lie-Flat Seating for Mint class to Caribbean if neededAs you can tell, my Miami Airport portion didn’t go well; but once we were in the Air, everything else went smoothly for the flight and in a few hours we were landing on this beautiful island that was being held completely hostage by transparent tropical blue waters around the entire outer edges. The Curacao airport was modern and clean and was so smooth for traveling through. We rented a normal car from Hertz at the Airport, but I did discover there is a rental car company on the island with Accessible vehicles to rent (Emma Rentals); who will either meet you at the airport with the vehicle or bring it to your hotel for you. Make sure to get good directions too before leaving the airport, or you will get lost trying to find your way around; unless you’re good with Dutch street signs. Arrivals in Curacao…so lovely. Dolphin Suites and Wellness Hotel When I first heard there was a fully-accessible hotel in Curacao, I was a big doubter; because who’s ever heard of something like that? However the same amazing team who developed the Curacao Dolphin Therapy and Research center on the island (See Day #2 of Curacao), also designed a hotel that addressed the needs of travelers with disabilities (of all types) and their families. Instead of thinking of it as an Hotel with Accessible rooms, think of more of a hotel that just happens to think-out ahead of time, how to best suit the needs of travelers with ALL levels of abilities; and offer them a hotel like no-other in the world. We pulled into the parking lot of the Dolphin Suites and Wellness Hotel late on Sunday evening and were just ready to collapse from the trip, but when you first roll into the lobby of the Dolphin hotel; you instantly feel this overwhelming sense of “I’m home” wash over you and feel the serotonin start flowing as you realize everything this hotel was designed with you mind and not some missed oversight. Hotel EntranceThe front office manager gave us a quick tour of the ground and first floor where we could find the two pools (1 with lift chair), island information and tour area, family BBQ dining (they will even pre-order your supplies), rental beach wheelchairs, the library and several lounge areas. There are ramps from the first to the second floor and the entire mid-rise hotel is serviced by an elevator. We were asked if we needed help with our luggage to our room, but my spouse likes to show off how strong he is when we travel by being our luggage wrangler; so we carried our own luggage up to our 2-bedroom suite with an ocean view on the 3rd floor. Lobby Front DeskYou almost take it for granted and don’t notice when first wheeling into the giant suite that everything is set up for your wheelchair to access. (Not like some hotels in the U.S. who call their rooms accessible, but basically give us a few extra feet around the bed or wider bathroom doors for our wheelchairs). You can’t even call it a hotel room because it felt more like a private apartment, with almost a full kitchen(which they will also pre-stock prior to arriving for you with food and groceries), large living room and a huge balcony with gorgeous ocean views. Seriously, I was ready to move in. My spouse had to stop me from literally making laps through all the different connecting rooms in our suite because I’m not used to having the entire home accessible to me. The hotel also has studio suites available (to cut down on people making laps); we just only had the 2-bedroom suite available when we went to make our reservations. 2-Bedroom Suite Living/KitchenThe suite had a master bedroom with a queen size bed and 2nd-bedroom with 2 twin size beds that would easily accommodate a full-size adult too. In case you need a lift or any other additional equipment during your stay, the hotel has a list of medical assistive devices to help make your trip easier and keep you from having to shlep all your gear from home. **(As a reminder: U.S. airlines do not charge you for bringing any additional luggage with medical equipment; check with each airline for their rules). Our master bedroom had the same incredible ocean view as the balcony, and it was hard to want to close the curtains till the sun was set for the night. I’m not one to endorse beds most of the time, since usually after a week a hotel mattress can be like lying a bed of nails to me; but this cloud of butter they picked out for a bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever found in any level of hotel. Master BedroomAnd that bathroom…OMGODDESS! They hit the Trifecta with the bathroom designs: A sink I can roll under; a toilet I can safely transfer to; and a roll-in shower I can easily bathe in and not freeze to death from. (Yes… I spent way too much time hanging in my bathroom this visit; just because I was so grateful I could). My only caveat and it’s just to prepare my U.S. travelers, is that to alert you the bathroom has standard European round, flat and narrow toilet seats; which is a little different then ones you may be used to. Not impossible to get used to, just didn’t want you to be in shock when discovering it. Also, I know you will think me tacky for saying this, but if you have gotten spoiled from the cotton like surface of U.S. toilet paper? Then stick a couple rolls of your favorite Charmin in your suitcase. All I want to do is keep you from ruining your vacation from a bottom destroyed by sand paper(… Just sayin). Accessible BathroomBack down by the pool in the front of the hotel is a Wellness Spa with massages, masks, mani’s, petti’s and more for ALL the customers of the hotel (there is a menu of services on the hotel website). Surrounding the delicious pool edges are plenty of comfy pool lounges and chairs to swallow you up for the day and the pool lift chair is easy to access with the help of someone from the front desk who is just a few feet away. They have these great, big, fuzzy, blue beach towels to loan you for using on-site or anywhere you may be heading on the island (as many as you can get wet and sandy). The second pool is behind the hotel and has a much quieter and calmer feeling (I nicknamed it the grown-up pool because I never saw any of the kids in that pool; but not a rule). That’s also where the BBQ area is, so it makes a great area to spend the afternoon and just have a hotel staycation for a day. When you are ready to make some plans to finally leave the hotel (you won’t want to, but you should), come back by the front office and they will help you book some activities and help you figure out how to get there and back. That’s assuming you aren’t like me and book your activities 6+ months in advance after exhaustive searches or didn’t just book from all my travel advice? Front Pool and Spa Rear Pool BBQ Area next to Rear PoolTo wrap it up, I have never experienced anything like I did staying at the Dolphin Suites. You don’t realize until you need it, what a dream it is to finally stay in a hotel that actually thought about “You” when designing the hotel and having to check out at the end of the week almost broke my heart. Thankfully the hotel general manager pointed out that the two buildings being built next door are part of the expansion plans for the hotel and my spouse promised me a return trip to the island to check them out when finished. Although when you hear about the rest of my week in Curacao, you’ll see it takes very little to convince anyone to return to the island after the fabulous week we had. Overhead Photo of Hotel, Mambo Beach, the Curacao Dolphin Therapy and Research Center and AquariumLast but certainly not least, I wanted to take a moment to applaud the entire team working at the hotel for delivering us 5-star service and making us feel so welcome; as if they knew us for years from the moment we rolled into the hotel (actually for months sooner as they had to put up with all my enquiry emails). Sometimes it’s the people that make all the difference for travelers with disabilities when we stay somewhere; especially when they understand all our special needs and not make us feel awkward for having to ask for help. It literally took me 2 hours to have my emotional goodbye with the hotel team (and that NEVER happens when I stay anywhere). Dreaming of my next stay with the Dolphin Suites…hopefully when I come back for the two-week therapy program for people with disabilities at the Curacao Dolphin Therapy and Research Center someday. Coming Next Monday: Day 2…Speaking of Dolphin Therapy, come back next week to learn about Day 2 in Curacao, where I got to try out the 1-day Therapy Program at the Curacao Dolphin Therapy and Research Center; and spend the afternoon at the Cabana Beach Club in the Accessible VIP section.

922,"My name is Danielle, and I am a disabled content creator. My channels are called Daniellevates because the content is all about elevating ideas about disability and rare disease. Full-length vlogs feature accessibility reviews from my adventures in Boston and beyond. Short form content will consist of series such as Breaking the 4th Wall of Disability, Daniellevates Investigates, Accessible Design in the Wild, and more! Since birth, I have had an extremely rare technically undiagnosed neuromuscular disease. The highlighted event is Lady Gaga’s Chromatica Ball Concert at America’s oldest baseball stadium – Fenway Park! Some highlights from the concert are shown, as well as our review after the show and a view from the accessible seats in the LOGE section of Fenway Park. Watch the full video here. I give my review of Fenway Park as a concert venue, and I also reiterate the need to plan ahead and to utilize the accessible seats if you need them because Fenway Park was not originally built with accessibility in mind. The seats are very narrow and there are many stairs. However, the accessible seats are great and the staff is very helpful! The atmosphere at Fenway cannot be beat on a summer night. We planned to hang out in the city the day after the concert, so we stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton in Newton, MA which is about a 20 minute drive from Fenway Park. It was a super nice hotel! Since we only stayed one night, we just booked a regular room, so you will see a tour of that. There are many reasons why people seek accessible rooms. Some people need particular emergency alarms if they are Deaf or Hard of Hearing, for example. Always think ahead of what you need and don’t settle for less even if it is ""just one night.” I made my “one night” exception this time because my main reason for an accessible room is the shower, and I knew that I would not be there long enough for that. This vlog is a perfect example of the mishaps that can happen if you don’t plan ahead for an outdoor event. The weather is unpredictable for these events, so most of the time people are so focused on whether it is going to rain or not that they forget another big factor: the heat. While we dressed appropriately (for the weather and a Lady Gaga concert – someone asked us if we were going to the show in the elevator at the hotel), we didn’t really focus on hydration and it was a hot night. I felt those effects after the show! For outdoor events, an obvious inconvenience is the post-show traffic. Everyone is leaving at the same time and trying to leave the same place. This chaos is why it is important to know your exits and to plan your intended exit. We ended up going out a different way than we came in, and we got stuck in a huge crowd. Not only was it dangerous since my balance isn’t good and I was fatigued after the concert, but there was no way that an Uber could get to our area. To make matters worse, my bad stomach added a little drama to the evening! If you have a bad stomach like me, it is important to know where your bathrooms are and to not get stuck in an area without one. If I had planned ahead to exit the most accessible way to the main road, this extra suspense could have been avoided. Also, if you have a bad stomach and find yourself using random bathrooms, this vlog might give you a relatable chuckle when I talk about how I was walked in on not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES. We actually got these tickets in early 2020, and the concert got postponed twice, so I knew this would be a night to remember. Well now I remember it for all kinds of reasons! However, I know these reasons taught me some valuable lessons for future adventures and I hope that they serve you well! Watch the full video here. Key Takeaways: • If you need accessible seating for your health and safety, don't overthink it. Utilize these seats! • Make a list weeks before the show of what equipment and supplies that you will need. Call the venue ahead of time to see their bag size limitations, and if needed ask what can be done for all of your supplies to be able to be taken into the venue. • Research the best exit before the show. Typically venues have phone numbers or emails for accessibility questions. While there is typically staff around the accessible sections during the event, it is always best to plan ahead. • Even if you don’t have a bad stomach, knowing where the bathrooms are is just great advice. If you can’t relate to this piece of advice, well, I am very jealous! • Plan ahead for all types of weather: hot, cold, rain, sun, etc. Make a hydration plan, and stick to it! • In the accessible section, some people may stand or some may sit. Do what is best for you and remember that everyone, no matter who you are, can dance! • If there is a theme of any sort, dress the part. You will thank me when you see your pictures.",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

After reserving a ride more than a month in advance and then re-confirming the ride a few days before, when we got there they said they had no vehicle for us and could not help us, even though they agreed we had reserved a ride with them.

Every 5 years I usually get a new mobility scooter. Medicare covers them at 80% every 5 years, and by then I usually need a new one pretty badly. The last two scooters I have got have been Pride Victory 10’s, mainly because I didn’t have much of a choice. When you weigh 400 plus pounds, there are not many choices of DME Medicare will cover even at 80% for you. So I got 2 of the same scooters. They are well made, I don’t usually have a problem with it unless you are trying to fit it into a smaller space. It was a BIG scooter, for a BIG girl, and it is to heavy for me to break apart and put in the back of a vehicle if I want to go out with friends for the day etc. Oh! I also do not have a vehicle of my own, so getting places with my big scooter has been a problem. Here it is time again to change out my big scooter, and this year I am a little bit more excited about it because I am hoping I have more choices that Medicare will cover. I now weigh 298 lbs and still working on dropping more! My goal is to start getting out more, travel more, and have much more of a life than I have had for many years. I’m single 59 yrs old, and I need to have something that works much better for me that I can manage on my own. I see alot of people are getting “Folding wheelchairs” now days. Are any of them covered at 80% by Medicare? I really want something I can pick up and load in a vehicle at the spur of the moment and go if I need to. I’ve never had anything but a scooter, and don’t even know if I would like a wheelchair but I’m thinking I want something different??? Something to live life a bit easier with now. Also would the foldable chairs work for everyday use or are they really just for travel? Do I need something else AND the foldable chair too?

My son has dmd and requires us to use a Hoyer lift when we travel. In the past, we would be able to use the lift with ease because the legs of the lift would fit under the bed. Now, with the solid box frame, the lift's legs can no longer get under these beds. Argh!!! Our work around is to bring bed risers. I will lift the frame and rest it onto the risers.

288,"They called the cops on us. My son and I were traveling from Toulouse to Bordeaux on August 15th 2024 around 10 am. My son is in a wheelchair which I mentioned online at the time of booking. The site explained that we were automatically upgraded to first class and assistance will be available to help us to get to the platform. It was not clear, as we found out later that we had to contact the Reduced Mobility Assistance service directly to book their support once we got to the train station. Perhaps, we should not have inferred that since we were automatically flagged as being handicapped that the rest of the process would naturally follow suit. When we got to the train station in Toulouse, I went to the disability office where a man said he couldn’t find our reservation. I explained to him that I had a person in a wheelchair and several pieces of luggage. I asked him what I should do. I explained that I was carrying three suitcases and three bags in addition to having to take care of my son. Being dual national my French is flawless so there was nothing lost in translation. That man coldly stared at me and said “Do whatever you want, sir” indicating that he was washing his hands off the entire thing. My jaw dropped. He and his buddies were sitting idly in that office, just chit-chatting and looking at me. All of them had heard the conversation I just had with that man but none offered ANY assistance. I stormed out of the room before we parted with choice words. He told me: “to go f…my mother” in English. I took my son’s 3 suitcases, including a large one, and 3 bags ON MY OWN while people watched me struggle to get to the platform. I was able to find the elevator and we made it to the platform. My back and my shoulders were killing me. There was no way I could have done that in several trips as that would have meant leaving the rest of my luggage unattended. Lo and behold the car that was assigned to us has no ramp but 3 steep steps. Contrary to what we were told, it was not a first-class car but a regular-class car with no ramp to help a wheelchair in. My son could not stand so I ran in a panic seeking help as I was concerned that the train would leave without us. I saw a big man and I called on him, saying (in French) “Please, please “. He glanced at me and then went back to chatting with his friend. I turned around and asked him again to come pointing at my son. “Monsieur, s’il vous plait”. My son was sitting next to the track and I was concerned. He finally moved at a leisurely pace and told me “I can’t come if you don’t tell me what this is about”. I pointed at my son in the wheelchair and said “I need help”. Then I ran to my son’s side. He took a look at us and said “You didn’t tell me what you want from me” and walked away. Next to my son was our luggage for which we would have appreciated some help and my son was facing steep stairs. That clearly was not self-explanatory, nor my ‘help, help’ or even my “s’il vous plait”. How can someone who sees someone else in a wheelchair needing help walk away needing help walk away is beyond me. I hauled our stuff Pell mell inside the train and carefully helped my son by holding him walk up the steps. He is 20 years old and although light, I am a man in my 60s. I saw that man standing a few cars away chatting with passengers and I admit I lost it “I yelled if there’s an accident it’ll be your fault, a** hole”. My son made it inside lying on the floor when finally that man came. Not to help but to yell enraged at me pushing his face into mine. “Do you think I am your dog?” He brayed, pretending that the real issue was the fact that I said ‘please” while pointing at my son. That was not enough information for him to come to our rescue. . As a matter of fact, i have too much respect for dogs to have mistaken one of them with a man who was probably one of the most despicable people I ever had to deal with. I am not the kind to back down and my face remained to his the whole time. He threatened to call the cops to have us ejected from the train. I replied, ‘by all means, I would like to talk to them too”. The cops did indeed show up as well as the first guy from the disabled office. One thing to know about the French is that they never let you finish your sentence, so a giant brouhaha ensued. I just stared calmly and looked at the head cop in the eyes. He finally was able to bring some quiet and explained to me that that man was not authorized to provide help to people in a wheelchair. I replied that we could talk protocol but we can also talk decency and humanity. How is a father supposed to react in the situation I found myself in? Wheelchair, person, baggage on a platform and with a train about to depart any minute and a man who does not even offer to help with the luggage, content to let a disabled passenger on a platform? A man who can see a person in a wheelchair in need and chooses to walk away. Callous and cynical do not begin to describe it. They finally let us go and the female conductor offered to provide us with help at our arrival. 4 people in total were on the platform at our destination but only 2 of them including the lady helped with the luggage. I told my French friends about this incident and their answer was telling:” We can’t even say that we are surprised “.",child pet handicap,1,1,1,0,0,0,disputed

For 33 years, we thought Alex, had nonverbal autism, intellectual disability, ADHD, but a few years ago we found out that he has Phelan McDermid. Alex goes on many trips with us, but this time the plane trip is too far. There are many reasons we make these videos. One reason we make these videos because I love watching travel videos. I love to dream about my next vacation so I'm challenging myself to learn to make my own. I hope we can help others dream about their vacations. Another reason we make these videos is to share the world with Alex and others who are unable to make a journey to Japan, and for those with disabilities whose comfort may be increased by knowing a little bit more about accessibility. We also have no idea what Alex understands receptively, so videos are a way to visually communicate where we went for three weeks. He likes to use his eye gaze communication device to watch his vacation videos, so now in a way he can see Japan with us. Our videos, Goal 1: Joyful Life are based on our family's journey and strategies we use to improve the quality of our life through meaningful leisure experiences. It is our hope to reach our number one goal of having a joyful life and to help others reach that goal too. We are hoping that our videos will encourage everyone to get out and have fun.",child handicap,1,0,1,0,0,0,disputed

1214,"I just wanted to share a recent stay experience. This was the best accessible room experience I have ever had. The hotel was TRU by Hilton in the city of Garner, North Carolina, which is just outside of Raleigh. I am not sure if all of their hotels follow the same design. This was a relatively new building. There was ample room to navigate in the room, between the two queen size beds, and in the bathroom. There was plenty of grab bars and low hooks for hanging things. The shower was roll in with an optional hand held shower attachment of which the height could be adjusted. There was also a seat in the shower, which could fold up or down. The height of the beds was spot on. I am not a chair user, but I have a bariatric size walker and face similar navigational challenges and the super high beds are a major problem for both myself and my 4’11”daughter. The only drawbacks I experienced was the entry door to the room is very heavy, making it difficult to get through without someone to hold it open. There is a mini fridge but no in room coffee maker or microwave. Both are available in the lobby 24-7. The other thing is that we were on the fifth floor. I am sort of OK with that as I feel like the odds of an emergency situation are relatively low. It does seem like hotels would put all of the mobility accessible rooms on the first floor though. :woman_shrugging:t2: overall, I was extremely pleased with my stay, and I will definitely be choosing this chain in my future travels if it is an option.",child handicap,1,0,1,0,0,0,disputed

1625,"Hi there! Emily here from accessibleGO. I wanted to share something that I have found so so helpful over the past few years. For some background, I am an ambulatory wheelchair user, where I can walk on my knees to get around, due to my knees being permanently bent, and I use a wheelchair in public/long distances. I’ve had custom power and manual wheelchairs my entire life. Right before COVID hit, I was gearing up for more independent travel and needed a wheelchair to fit that need. I found that there are many standard wheelchairs that are now made that are meant for travel and to be FAA compliant (pre-approved for planes). The one I have weighs 50lbs, folds up to be the size of a suitcase, and has removable batteries. The price of these range from $1500 - $3500, and likely would not be covered by insurance - I didn’t even try for mine. This has revolutionized my ability to travel. Since it is a secondary chair for me, I’m not afraid to get it a little beat up, LOL. In my 2.5 years of owning it, I’ve taken it on countless flights, thrown in many many Ubers, and been all over the country with it. It allows me to Uber, and to Uber alone too. I usually just ask the Uber driver to lift it in for me, and they usually have no problem doing so. If they are having trouble, we find a friendly nearby stranger to help us out. Battery lasts me well over a day’s usage. On a normal week, I charge it about once a week. It doesn’t fit me quite right as it’s a standard chair, but I don’t mind. My friends know how to operate it easily as well. If you can afford it and are looking for a travel chair, something that can get a little more beat up and can easily go on planes, I 1000% recommend. Also, this isn’t paid or sponsored or anything, just my personal experience. 🤩 Link to the one I have, but you can find a ton of options if you search for “FAA Approved Wheelchairs” All the best!!",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

44,"So we are home from our 2-week tour of the great Southeast. We stayed exclusively in Hilton products - Hampton Inn, Embassy Suites, and 2 different Hilton Garden Inns. Of the four, I would have to say that the Hampton Inn (Charleston, West Virginia) the most budget-friendly of the hotels, which offered a free breakfast, the best accessible room, with a low bed, reachable amenities, a roll-in shower, separate shower chair and who honored our request for a feather-free room with extra pillows. The Embassy Suites Louisville Downtown East also offered a complimentary breakfast and a manager’s welcome event on weekdays, featuring free beer, wine, and salty snacks. Upon request, a maintenance team removed the bed frame so it was easy to transfer from my wheelchair. The bathroom fixtures and amenities were much too high, even in the shower. The Hilton Garden Inn Nashville Convention Center had accessible rooms with regular beds (too high for me with nothing to be done about it) and apparently the same accessible room on a higher floor that had a lower bed about which the guest complained. Neither of us was offered the chance to switch rooms to be more comfortable. Nice roll-in shower with a pull-down bench, but the amenities were again too high. Hilton Honors members could have a $10 a day meal credit for up to 2 people. (Odd as there were 3 of us in 2 rooms.). None of the housekeepers, busboys, or maintenance people spoke English. Also, no safe in the room, and the safe deposit boxes were too small for a computer. A bonus - the hotel was within walking distance of most museums and attractions except for those in the Opryland area. The Hilton Garden Inn in Asheville, NC, was very similar to its sister hotel in Nashville, but the staff was much nicer about accessibility issues. The safe deposit boxes were even smaller and could not contain my travel jewelry box. Front desk staff were nice about directing us to events usually staged only for locals (the Shindig Bluegrass Concert). Most attractions in downtown were not very far from the hotel, but you did need to drive or take the courtesy shuttle, which was NOT wheelchair accessible. Lastly, the wheelchairs. The first wheelchair ordered from Clouds of Goods never worked right until it stopped working at all. Cloud of Goods did not respond to 3 phone calls and 2 emails, noting the various problems with the chair, except to send me a marketing email. The owner of the franchise that provided the chair was especially rude and refused to call a technician to repair the chair, even though it was still under warranty. He promised to refund the rental fee, but when I got home, there was a charge to my credit card, but no credit. I am disputing the charge, however. We rented a second chair from Scootaround in Asheville. Separate delivery and pickup fees were $95. My hubby picked up the chair himself, but no one showed him how to fold the chair or lift the arms to transfer. The chair that was provided was too small for my generously sized bottom. When I called to see if an HD model might be available to rent, I was told I would need to be 100 pounds heavier to receive that kind of chair i.e. this was the only chair this company rented. So, we made do. Even with the good restaurants in Asheville, I did not think I could gain 100 pounds in that shor a period of time. Our favorite sites were my family in Louisville, the African American Museum of Music in Nashville, the Western North Carolina Wildlife Center outside of Asheville, and, of course, all the Buccee’s we stopped at along the way.",child handicap,1,0,1,0,0,0,disputed

830,"My name is Danielle, and I am a disabled content creator. Since birth, I have had an extremely rare technically undiagnosed neuromuscular disease. My channels are called Daniellevates because the content is all about elevating ideas about disability and rare disease. Full-length vlogs feature accessibility reviews from my adventures in Boston, Walt Disney World, NYC, and beyond. Short form content will consist of series such as Breaking the 4th Wall of Disability, Daniellevates Investigates, Accessible Design in the Wild, and more! Have you ever been to a Museum of Science? If not – I highly recommend it! While the vlog highlighted is all about Boston’s Museum of Science, visiting a museum like this is a recommendation that I give when people are looking for a place that both kids and adults will enjoy when visiting a city. Boston’s Museum of Science takes the #1 spot, but they also list 23 other Museums of Science on this list . While I can’t vouch for the general awesomeness or accessibility of other museums of science like I can Boston’s, they are just a location idea to keep in mind if you are looking for an activity that all ages could enjoy. If you are interested in learning more about Boston’s Museum of Science, continue reading below and consider watching my vlog showcasing it. The Museum of Science is very accessible, and there is really something for everyone. Every time I go, there seems to be great new exhibits in addition to the old favorites like visiting the animals. The Live Animal Care Center is home to approximately 120 animals, representing more than 50 species. The AI exhibit is very timely, and it was interesting to see the Boston Dynamics robots up close! I am so used to seeing them on the news every few months with the new (and sometimes alarming) skills that they have learned, so it was super interesting to see them in person! I love the new Arctic Adventure exhibit . It is super interactive which is something that I appreciate for many reasons. One: I love immersive experiences. Two: for people with varying types of disabilities, having options that involve the different senses makes the exhibit more inclusive. The vlog heavily features The Prince Experience , which is a show under a dome screen that is a musical experience that fuses music with engaging visuals set to a Prince’s Purple Rain soundtrack. These shows happen in the Charles Hayden Planetarium. We unknowingly attended the show on the 7th Anniversary of Prince’s passing. While I couldn’t film the music due to copyright restrictions, this was an almost meditative experience with the audio and visuals. I definitely recommend it if the visuals won’t bother you, because there are some “trippy” aspects to it. They cycle through the shows, so as of the writing of this blog (October 2023), the Prince Experience isn’t there but in its place are the experiences of David Bowie, Lady Gaga, and TheDivas (think Whitney Houston and Celine Dion). The auditorium also has other types of shows, and here are a few examples: Big Bird’s Adventure, Monthly Sky Charts, and God, Science, and Our Search for Meaning. They also have 4-D shows including Sea Lion, Octonauts: Amazon Adventure, and Tiny Giants. While I didn’t watch a 4-D show during this vlog, I have in the past and I think that they are worth it! Additionally, they also have live presentations. If you are interested in any of these shows, make sure that you research ahead of time and potentially buy your tickets early. Someshows, like the Prince Experience, are an additional cost. One awesome bonus that the vlog doesn’t feature is that Boston Duck Tours depart from in front of the Museum of Science entrance. A Boston Duck Tour is one of the best ways to tour Boston. By riding on one of the Duck Boats that traverses the city by both land and water, you will visit many unique neighborhoods before splashing into the Charles River for an incredible view of the Boston and Cambridge skylines. These Duck Boats are wheelchair accessible! (If you book online you MUST call the company to tell them that you are a wheelchair user since they pull 3 extra seats to fit the wheelchair. If you book in person, make sure to tell the Guest Service Representative that you are a wheelchairuser). For those who are not wheelchair users but have other mobility needs, they will set up the wheelchair lift to assist you if you are unable to climb stairs. Whether you are interested in math, engineering, physics, medicine, zoology, astronomy, ecology, archeology, technology…. (you get the picture)…. there will be something for you at this museum. The interactive hands-on exhibits are sure to keep children young and old entertained. On Accessibility • The Museum of Science is equipped with an assistive listening system. This system amplifies the presentations of the Museum’s stages and theaters. Visitors can borrow a receiver and headset, or neck loop, at the Information Desk in the lobby. The Museum of Science is also an AIRA access site. • Visitors who are blind or low-vision can download the AIRA app free of charge onto a smart phone. The AIRA app uses the phone’s camera to take in the user’s surroundings, and a live AIRA agent will describe the environment, including reading of exhibit labels and instructions. This service is free of charge at the Museum. • The museum offers interpreters and sighted guides, but requests for these should be made at least two weeks prior to your visit. • The Museum has 10 adult-sized manual wheelchairs, 2 pediatric wheelchairs, 2 bariatric wheelchairs, 7 strollers, and 5 electric scooters (you have to be 18+ to operate the electric scooter) that guests may borrow for free. They are available on a first-come, first-served basis. I borrowed one of their scooters which made the visit easier since I didn’t have to transport mine in the car. • The Museum even offers assistance with pre-visit planning, including information and suggestions tailored to an individual’s needs - including sensory needs. They note that quieter times to visit are Saturday and Sunday mornings and weekday afternoons (during the school year). • The museum has multiple accessible and family bathrooms. It also has Sensory-Friendly Restrooms that don’t have hand dryers or auto flush mechanisms. You can check out their website for more information. • They have an Accessibility Coordinator on staff to assist visitors with questions regarding accessibility. I really can’t think of one reason not to visit Boston’s Museum of Science if you have the opportunity!",child pet handicap,1,1,1,0,0,0,disputed

Unfortunately the airline stripped and broke the connection to my smartdrive. As a result I had to take a Lyft everywhere with the giant loaner the airlines provided. I also hurt myself when I went to sit in my wheelchair not knowing there was something wrong with the brake as well but I’m better after four months.

The airline rep just said submit bills but with medical stuff it’s complicated. Also my sweet hubby was very concerned about me traveling with a wheelchair to begin with and now he’s convinced I shouldn’t fly with my wheelchair which is not an option. How can I protect my wheelchair so it doesn’t happen again? For this trip I just rode up to the plane, took off the smartdrive and they loaded it.

Either a circular moving door or two doors with no push button entrance or doorman. The hotel’s own staff say they have complained to upper management about it. Upper management has either not heard about ADA or just doesn’t care about people with disabilities who travel. Or mothers with strollers, or, well you get it. There was one accessible bathroom stall on a floor with “the largest ballroom in Connecticut” and it was out of order for most of my stay. Despite the printed “out of order” sign on the door, hotel management was unaware that the bathroom was out of service. Really? Of the two women’s bathrooms on the lobby floor, one (near the registration desk) does not have an accessible stall and the one, across a very large lobby, has a heavy door so I never did make it in to check. Entering the hotel room requires two hands, one for the key (yes, key) and one for the handle. So which one can propel my wheelchair? They don’t care. The hotel room was so dense with furniture, there was nowhere to turn around. There was no space for me to turn to access the sink (not in the bathroom). The roll-in shower was so small that one could not roll in! The shower chair (which required 3 phone calls to get) did not adjust for height and took up almost the entire shower. The showerhead was so high it was unreachable and, if I could reach it, there was no way to fix it to a lower space. The result was the showerhead would just shoot water everywhere but on me.

I’ve put some of the questions I’d like to answer in my packet below! - What accessibility measures has the venue hotel taken? How have they implemented ACA standards? Has the staff had disability training? - Can the venue accommodate special requests for guests staying at the venue? - Is there luggage assistance available for guests staying in the hotel? - Is the Westin service dog friendly? Are there service dog relief areas? If so, where? - Is there a special process to reserve an accessible room? What kinds of accessible rooms are available? - Is the front door accessible, or is there a separate accessible door? - Has the venue had any kind of disability awareness training? - What is the walking terrain around the venue like? - Where is the closest accessible parking to the door guests should enter? - Will accessible doors be unlocked from both directions for the entire conference? Will they be locked at certain hours? - How far is it between conference rooms and guest rooms? Are there elevators on the obvious route between these locations? If conference rooms are spread out, what is the furthest one might need to move between sessions? - Is there braille signage throughout the building?",pet handicap,1,1,0,0,0,0,disputed
71,"Hello, I want to report that Paris has a reliable ramp equipped taxi service. The 2024 Paris Paralympics gave the city a goal of adding reliable taxi service for those who need or want to stay in their ♿. Nearly a year later, it appears the service is still strongly in existence. First off G7 is the name of Paris' app based taxi service. The app works just like Uber or Lyft. But in Paris it's called G7, and they are professional taxi drivers, not part time gig workers. When using the service, enter your address information. select NOW or LATER buttons from the menu, and after that you will see the (attached) screen. Choose G7 Access from near the bottom of the list. Et voilà! What you'll get is smallish black delivery van with a rear entry ramp. The four times I've used the service, the driver knows exactly what to do to load you safely and politely. Away you go. The only imperfection is sometimes the waiting time for a ramp taxi is 30 minutes more than an ordinary sedan. Outside of rush hour, I don't see an additional wait. But at rush hour, it is a possibility. I see these ♿ taxis all over town, all the time. So I believe the system is robust outside of the times I've used it myself. Praise Paris for this innovation! Lastly as a related postscript note, Paris has a very good bus system for getting around town if you don't want to roll. Yes the famous Metro is 80‰ unaccessible. BUT the busses are great and easy to use. A ramp is deployed. You get on-board and away you go. There is no tedious tie down negotiations with the driver. They just don't bother to tie you down. I've only used the G7 ramp service to go to the airport at times or for a long cross town trip, with several bus transfers to an appointment.",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed
196,"Our train from Munich to Switzerland was of course not on time. We missed the connection in Zurich. But the person who met the train to help me disembark was wonderful. He put our bags in storage (for free), and we got to wander the town in the pouring rain. There was a nice Christmas market inside the station though so we got food and looked around. When we went to get our bags the helper even gave us free food tickets for the inconvenience. Our hotel said they were accessible on the phone. They were but barely. I wish designers understood that wheelchairs rarely turn sharp corners the same. The lift was big enough for me, chair and husband, barely. Sometimes you get what you pay for and we got a cheap place. We bought our Swiss Half Fare card when we got there as the trains are expensive. If you are going to be in Switzerland and using the lifts, trains or buses (almost all are wheelchair accessible) then check out the many passes available. My husband got to do his sledding run, even though it was on a shorter run as the longest in the world was closed for lack of snow. He came home smiling and ready to move there. That is until he got a nasty flu bug! We ended up stuck inn our hotel room for 4 days because of flu and a freak snowstorm. Merry Christmas. The towns do their best to clear sidewalks and such quickly but I tried going out for food once and just wandered from slush puddle to slush puddle. Luckily our hotel had a restaurant on the ground floor where we could get food. The town was very easy to navigate in my chair. All of the sidewalks were cut in to allow crossing the road anywhere. I loved that. Stores were mostly accessible. As usual there are places with a step in front but not many. The Swiss trains were a joy to ride. Easy to understand and the staff in the stations were very helpful. We appreciated that a lot of the trains didn’t need a lift to access. The WC cars have a ramp that folds out automatically when you open the door to bridge the gap. We will come back someday. It is a beautiful and friendly country.",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

1116,"ADA currently does not have requirements about which bars should be where in bathrooms that include necessary standards for people who have both disabilities related to standing and also disabilities related to their hands. There needs to be a bar on both sides of the toilet when there is only one toilet available whether needs to be one toilet room with bars on the right side and one with bars on the left side. In hotels this means that if there are two or more handicap rooms, one should be set up with the bar on the left side of the toilet and one with the bar on the right side of the toilet. The hotel rooms the bars on the toilet and in the shower should be set up the same. The same is true for restaurants. But in restaurants there is a separate issue. When you are of one sex and you go out with somebody of the opposite sex. Under the current standards. If you need help with the toilet. One of you is required to go into the bathroom the other sex. This means that the real standard should be that there are separate family rest rooms rather than the stalls in regular bathrooms because that's the only way to make it unnecessary for people of one sex not to be required to go to the bathroom of people of the opposite sex. That should be the ADA standard, rather than separate stalls in bathrooms for other people. To the extent that people on this form can contact the US Access Board to support this approach, please do so. Yours, Ross Dolloff",child handicap,1,0,1,0,0,0,disputed

1768,"Over this last weekend I had one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. First off I only saw 1 handicapped parking space in the parking lot as we approached The Peddler in Greenville, SC. It was poorly located so we avoided it. The walkway to the door was flagstone and many stones were uneven and some were loose and sliding around on top of others. The incline was horrific; you needed climbing gear. We were told mo Saturday reservations so we took a chance. Were told at arrival 15-20 minutes. Forty minutes passes and my son in law goes to hostess (our party of 3 is the only party in the waiting room). Hostess says next table is ours as soon as it is cleaned. A party of 6 enters the waiting room. One lady comments about the climb up the walkway and says she feels like she is at Disney. She turns and asks me how in the world did you do it with the walker. I told her my 2 companions, 1 in front, 2 in back. I told my daughter that I needed to use the restroom. She said she would hold door as it had a sign saying step down. Biy, they weren’t kidding; 3 very narrow, very shallow and very steep steps going down to restroom with only old timey screen for pulls to hold. Those had been screwed into the wall in 3 places. Two stalls were there but neither handicapped. There were no grab bars nor extra width. If course had I been in a wheelchair or power chair I could not have gotten to front door unless I was air lifted in. My daughter had my walker as it wouldn’t fit through doorway. Ig it was not my 3 wheeler I could not have maneuvered a walker amongst the furniture. I also noticed their pedestal sink wobbled as it was not attached. I slowly climbed back up the steps (3rd one was a doozy) and retrieved my wheels from my daughter. I noticed party of 6 was gone but we were not. Son in law goes to hostess and she was extremely rude to him and says “well they’re a party of 6” as if that explains why were eere skipped over. My daughter goes to hostess and woman hisses at her “I 've got you right here”. My daughter replied"" no, you don’t because we’re leaving. At that point we had been there over an hour. My daughter pulled car as close as she dared to walkway while my son in law accompanied me down those same flagstones. It was just as scary going down. I don’t cars if their food is lined in gold it is not worth a broken limb. Ladies would not be safe to wear heels as not only would they risk breaking a heel they would also risk breaking one or more bones. I have been a guest in many fine restaurants created out of historic buildings but all have modified their buildings for handicapped accessibility.

However, this ramp is far from ADA requirements. It is about 18 feet long and about 3 foot high which gives it a very steep slope. We had to push my husband in his power wheelchair up the ramp and hold back on the chair when he went down. Otherwise, he would have slid down the ramp. We stayed the week because of distance traveled and vacation time already booked, but mainly because we had four strong adult children with us who could help us up and down the ramp. Be aware and request dimensions and pictures for any rental that claims to be Handicap Accessible. I put in a complaint with VRBO when we got home but they said they can do NOTHING because the trip had ended already. It’s been almost a week since I told them but the house is still listed as handicap accessible.

Imagine my surprise when I checked out the deck plans and found no handicapped accessible staterooms. I was chatting with a lady who wouldn't believe me when I said that. She said surely that wasn't true in this current age. She thought I had overlooked them. She suggested that I call so I did. I was correct. On their river and saltwater cruises overseas there are ABSOLUTELY NO HANDICAPPED ACCESSIBLE STATEROOMS. Thei Viking rep suggested I check out cruises on the Mississippi River where they do have some handicapped accessible staterooms. And why you ask are these their only handicapped staterooms. It is because they are operating these Mississippi cruises within the U S. and they have to abide by the (ADA). the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires accessibility for all possible passengers. In other words, the law requires them to make ther U.S. operating ships accessible to all. Once you leave the U.S. there is no comparable oversight law which requires accessibility. Because they have chosen to deny a large portion of today's traveling public, I choose to not do business with them in the U.S. I am also asking other disabled American travelers to not support the company in their U.S. cruises.",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

They say you should dedicate at least 10 hours a day to your startup, but honestly, I've been living and breathing this project 24/7. Pitch draft after pitch draft, mock presentation after mock presentation I've refined and redefined WheelCraft. It's been a relentless cycle of writing, rewriting and revision. Voiceovers, the voiceover! I've considered every structure: should it be Articles of Incorporation? Articles of Organization? What’s the difference? Should I start in the state that I’m in or start in the state that I wanna be finished in? An LLC or Sole Proprietorship? The journey has been a roller coaster of decisions and learning. There are a few things that I am sure of throughout this entire endeavor and they are my mission, my purpose, intent and my logo. For all else as the stars come into alignment, so will the rest of the plan. For if it is written, it shall be done. The support from Arlan's All Access and Arlan's Academy has been an absolute dream and I cannot forget the invaluable insights from the Women of Mighty, Couresera’s course AI for Everybody. And YouTube University; where I spend my days, my nights, my weekends, my life!

Educating them while nurturing a startup might sound of lunacy, but it's my reality. One highlight has been supporting the nine-year-old Sun Goddess adventures in her goal of becoming a published author. Watching her determination has been inspiring and reminds me daily why I'm doing all this. My ultimate dream? Leaving my descendants in a better place than I found them. While it may not have seemed evident until now, but I'm determined to create generational wealth and instill financial literacy in my grandchildren. I truly believe I've found my niche. An industry. This niche doesn't just benefit me—it benefits millions like me. We are differently mobile. We may not be on the same page as the upwardly mobile, but we seek the opportunity to be in the same book.

Thank you!!Cycleboy99 responds: 1) When you make your reservation/buy your ticket make sure you inform the airline that you will be traveling with your own wheelchair, if you are doing it online there is usually a place to request assistance and let them know about your needs.2) Make sure the airline fills out an inspection ticket and attached it to your wheelchair, that way if it is damaged in transit you have a way to make a claim with the airline.3) Let the agent at the check in desk and the agent at the gate know if you will need the aisle chair to get to your seat. Odds are you will if you can’t walk. Almost every large and medium sized airport has a contractor that supplies staff to do this, not the airline personnel themselves so there needs to be coordination between the airline and the assistance provider, especially since you will board first, which is always preferable. Nothing worse than sitting there waiting for the transfer people to come while all the other passengers are standing there waiting to board.4) You won’t be able to use the restroom most likely so plan your fluid intake accordingly and try to use the restroom just before you board. Most airlines start boarding 30 minutes prior to the listed departure time ( more than that for international flights). I usually try to use the restroom one hour before departure time. Also you are first on and last off so again, plan on not being avuto use a restroom till about 30 minutes after your scheduled arrival time (it usually takes about 20 minutes for everyone else to get off and for the assistance staff to get you off the plane and back in your chair.5) Tell the agents at the gate area that you want to “gate check” your wheelchair and have it waiting for you at the door of the plane at the conclusion of the flight. If you have a connecting flight make sure you explicitly tell them you want your chair at the conclusion of each leg, otherwise it may end up being transferred from one plane to the other plane with the rest of the checked luggage.6) I fly Southwest a lot and find that their staff is always good to work with and have an excellent attitude and deal well with wheelchair users. Also with Southwest they have open seating and if you are able to transfer independently and are of average size you may not need to use the aisle chair as the first row of seats are easily accessible to a wheelchair and you can transfer directly.7) Enjoy the ride!!For other tips and advice, head to our community forum.﻿ ﻿ What advice do you have for flying? | Manuel-F-O",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed
187,"Well our week in Barcelona is done. We are sad to be leaving. A week is not long enough. We stayed at the Orient Atrime on La Rambla, down closer to the port. It was wheelchair accessible but barely. When will those renovating old buildings learn to ask the disabled what is needed. One of the hardest parts is a narrow entry or hallway that has a 90 degree turn in it. I have left a few red scrapes of red paint on a few entries during this trip. Barcelona had 65 degree weather, sun, and was very accessible. Per usual many of the older shops and eateries had a step up to get in, but with the amount of choices we found others places to eat/shop. We found a great little restaurant close to our hotel. Guell Tapas, Carrer Nou de la Rambla 20. The paella was the best ever, the tapas were wonderful, the staff was great, and I could get inside. Once inside there is even a lift to get your chair down to the main dining room. It’s namesakes the Park Guell and Palau Guell were not. While I was able to get into Casa Mila. At Casa Mila they had me try to get my chair into the small lift before I bought a ticket. I just fit so went up. Very interesting. I noticed a weird click sound on the way down and we noticed I had lost a nut that held the front wheel on. So I sat in the sun on a warm bench and my husband found a hardware store nearby. My mechanic husband to the rescue again. All of the mass transit (buses, trains, trams and metro were accessible. We only used the train and the metro and it was easy. Next, a 2 day stop in Figures, Spain to see the Dali Museum. The train was easy out of Sants station. While we have been before we have never stayed overnight. We rented an NC Apartment 32. It was a great apartment. The manager never showed up to let us in. A neighbor called her and she let the neighbor let us in. It was a time wasting hassle. Next time I will cancel payment and get another room. The Dali Museum is awesome. But over the years they have moved things around and it was not accessible in most areas.

It has very well paved paths throughout the zoo. I even got bold and took my motorized wheelchair down the only path that was not paved. It was better then some cobblestone paved streets I’ve traveled. There are food stalls, great hot cocoa (spiked for the hearty), and a nice souvenir shop. The best thing is it is a wonderful family activity. We got the tickets and parking online. There are plenty of accessible parking spaces. There are time slots to entry, to keep it from becoming overrun. They even have hand warming stations sprinkled around.

875,"September 18, New York - In response to an internationally circulating petition calling on major commercial aircraft manufacturers to make accessibility a priority, Airbus has issued a statement saying the company is currently reviewing “several ideas”, which it will release details about at a latter date. The statement said these ideas relate to wheelchair accessibility. “Comfort and safety for wheelchair passengers, as well as the risk of wheelchair damages during transport, are challenges we already discuss with airlines--particularly focusing on the feasibility of traveling in a personal wheelchair and/or stowage of the same,” read the statement. “While we do not have details to release at this time--there are several ideas under review.” The statement said Airbus was also “following a proactive approach to covering a broader range of disabilities and accessibility beyond wheelchair related topics” in consultation with its airline customers, as well as encouraging innovation with universities and start-ups. Petition organizer, Pekka Paavonpera, a paraplegic since a spinal cord incident at a Massachusetts hospital in 2019, said he had hoped Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury would have weighed in on the subject, but at least the company had responded to the petition. Last month Boeing Co CEO David Calhoun, issued a statement giving his commitment to the company exploring accessibility for its future produced commercial aircraft. Paavonpera said at present passengers who have mobility issues are lifted from their wheelchairs at the boarding gate, on and off aisle chairs and into and out of their seats. There have been many documented cases of passengers being injured during this process, and wheelchairs being damaged when loaded as luggage. “This has gone on for decades and the time for action is now.” he said. The petition on-line link is https://chng.it/DpdHd7VMRZ . Paavonpera said the petition will continue collecting signatures so as to show Boeing and Airbus that there is a real need and an urgency for accessibility, and that both companies should introduce this before being required to do so through legislation. He said a timeline was needed from both companies as to when accessibility will be a standard feature on their new and refurbished aircraft. # Ends Photo shows Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury.",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

211,"We finally made it to Prague on a cold winter night. The first fun was getting off the train. It was a Czech train. Clean, on time, and accessible. You could tell that they do not get many wheelchair travelers. When it was time to get off the train 2 men began trying to use the onboard lift/ Clearly they had never used it before. Directions were asked for, delivered, and struggled with. It took about 10 minutes to finally get me off the train. I was suspended in the air over the platform for way too long. But I stayed cheerful and that made it much better. Prague is a rare beauty of a city. It is easy to get around. If you wear dentures be sure to add extra glue though, as the cobblestones were everywhere. With any very old city you are going to have to try and stay upbeat. There will not always be curb cuts when you want them. We backtracked many times to find one. Good news is the river boat cruise we went on was wc accessible. Seeing a city from the water is always a great experience. We got lost often as the roads are every which way. One night we finally pulled out the google maps (we leave phones off to avoid data roaming charges). We had walked around a quarter of the city. It was great. The Prague Castle…we found a short cut…hahaha. It was a super steep, old cobblestone, route. Do not use it. Follow the streets the Tram #22 uses to go up the hill. Better yet, use tram 22. We stayed at the Atlantic Hotel near the main square. It was walkable to everywhere and reasonably priced in an area that is very expensive. The pricing is probably so good because it hasn’t been decorated since the 70’s. But it was spacious, clean, affordable. As with most elevators in Europe it was small. When taking our luggage up we had to do it in 2 trips. I may have left a few paint scrapping on the door as it tried to eat me every time I got on or off. We have a strong love hate relationship now. But a great hotel all around. As usual I went to the train station 2 days before leaving to get my bearings and instructions. The man at the desk smiled and said just show up 20 minutes early and all will be well. I did and it wasn’t. On the day of travel they reprimanded me for not getting clearance 48 hours before,. I am sad to say I lost it. I did not stay upbeat but became the grouchy tourist, very grouchy. They said we couldn’t go on that train. We ran for it anyways. We stood trying to talk to the attendant and he refused to listen and literally our train left us virtually on the platform. We returned to the info desk. I stayed outside because at this point I was ready to create an international incident. My husband was treated very differently. They got us on a train 3 hours later. It was fairly uneventful. My husband said to add that the Czech trains 2nd class seats are a horror. So off we go to Krakow, Poland. ***If you want a really great Czech meal at reasonable prices check out Lokal. It is close to the main square but not on it. There are 2 entrances and one was accessible.",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed
339,"When Mariam asked me to do some writeups, I wasn’t sure exactly what she wanted, but it turns out that what I wrote was pretty on-target. Looking at the other writeups in this thread, however, makes me think I should warn the reader: It’s kind of long. So I’ll get to it without further ado except for the following bio. I’m getting to be an old fart. 66 last year, soon to be 67. I’ve often thought about what it will be to age as a T3-4 paraplegic, and it looks like I’m going to find out. I’ve aged well, though, and I still get around, which is what led me to AccessibleGo. And it looks like I like to talk and give advice. Being part of a community is also a good thing, especially as we age. I grew up in Jacksonville, FL, and started my first career there as a ballet dancer. Yes, I know that is a shocking story that you can’t write because it’s too tragic, but that’s what happened: When I was 30, at the height of my career, in 1988, I went rock climbing and fell and broke my back. I won’t go into the details of recovering from that kind of life-changing event—many of us have had similar accidents. Through all that, however, I met the woman who is now my wife. We have grandchildren (step-grandchildren for me, but they’re too young to know what that means, and I act just like a “Papa,” so it makes little difference.) Recovering after the injury, I went back to school and became an English teacher. That’s where I finally discovered my best talent—writing. Teaching is a difficult profession, but I found that it was a good fit for me since it kept me active and was intellectually stimulating. Now I write. Nothing that I ever expect to publish, mostly just stories for the grandkids. Through all those years, my wife and I traveled as much as possible because we knew that my future mobility was not guaranteed. Most of our travel has been in the US, but we’ve gone to Paris and to Mexico. Paris is the home that I’d never been to before—it is my favorite place on earth. We have found that it’s possible to travel at deep discounts if you do things like get the frequent flyer credit cards (that wave finally petered out, and it’s getting harder for me to fly anyway) or the hotel points credit cards (we still use these and get lots of free nights). You run your entire budget through the card to accumulate as many points as possible. The trick, though, is to pay that card off every month. You’ll be in trouble quickly if you don’t pay it off. We’re still traveling, especially now that we’re both retired, and we plan to keep doing it until we can’t. We’ve set our lives up so that we can travel as much as possible. I surprise myself when I know an answer to someone’s question in the group, but there’s no reason why I should be, except that I didn’t realize I was getting an education during all that travel. So that’s me—staying young as long as I can, traveling mostly by car, cashing in those hotel points. Now the main story (I have pictures, which I’ll also post here in the Reply section): Mission Beach: An Accessible Paradise Good morning, beach lovers! It’s currently a sunny 58° in Mission Beach on this beautiful December day, and we’re headed for a balmy 71°. Something’s brewing in the Pacific because the waves are running at 7-8 feet, glassy with fair form, stood up by a 5 MPH offshore breeze. Surf’s up! But be sure to wear your wetsuits, kiddies, because the water is a chilly 62°. Obviously, not many of us are going to be venturing into the surf, but these were the conditions on my recent visit to Mission Beach in San Diego, CA. And let me tell you, waves like that are beautiful . Mission Beach is what we might call a barrier island or, more accurately, a peninsula, of Mission Bay. It sits very accessibly at the end of W. Mission Bay Dr., just down the street from Sea World. If you enter the community from that direction, you need only make a left at Mission Blvd. (They do that here—there are a bunch of Torrey Pines streets, etc., in La Jolla). Mission Blvd. runs parallel to the beach, and it’s the last light before the ocean—you can see the end of the road which, for no apparent reason, past Mission Blvd., is called Ventura Place. After your left turn, there’s a large parking lot a block away on the right, just past Belmont Park (an amusement park), with at least a dozen accessible spaces that are thoughtfully placed in various parts of the lot. The surface is rather uneven here, so you may want to park carefully. It won’t matter to wheelchairs with suspension, but my ultralight will wobble and can be unsteady during transfers. There’s another large parking lot across Mission Blvd., with more accessible parking, and there are spaces that I didn’t mention in the lot at the end of Ventura Pl., behind the apparently defunct lifeguard station (they recently finished building a new one at the south end of the beach, next to the jetty). Accessibility is pretty good here. Ramps abound (this is California, after all), and just about anywhere you want to go, except the beach, of course, is paved. Right where you want it, next to this parking lot, is a restroom with accessible stalls and two single-use accessible restrooms facing the beach. This, however, is also the worst part of Mission Beach. I have seen these restrooms virtually unusable because of the filth that people leave in their wake. The restrooms are cleaned daily, however, so if you get there after about 8 AM, they should be freshly cleaned, even though they may still be wet from the cleaning. Everything is made of stainless steel, so it’s eminently cleanable but not very hospitable. Not to worry, however—for some reason, the single-use rooms don’t seem to get as trashed. Maybe they’re locked at night to keep people from sleeping there. They’re not pretty by any stretch—think prison cell—bare concrete floor, one-piece steel toilet, white-enameled walls. But they beat the multi-use restrooms, and you can take your companion with you. (Pro tip: Draft, the restaurant right next to the restrooms, runs a breakfast window, and they will usually let you use their clean and well-equipped restroom if you ask.) Ocean Front Walk—the boardwalk—runs 2.5 miles between the jetty, at the bay opening and the south end of the beach, to Crystal Pier, at the border of Pacific Beach, where it goes up the bluff into hillier terrain (I haven’t explored north of this spot because of the hills.) There’s also a public restroom near the pier, but no single-use rooms. There is a three-foot sea wall extending the entire length of this boardwalk because it’s at the level of the beach itself, and there are businesses and houses behind it, which need protection from storm surges. If you go from where we started at Belmont Park and walk south, you’ll see picnic tables and barbecue grills to your left on the well-packed, grassy knolls that overlook the beach. Past this, there are houses and rentals all the way to the jetty, some of which are wheelchair accessible (here I must leave the research to the reader, since you know your level of need better than I do). There are houses and cheaper rentals behind these, all the way to the bay, on the other side of this spit of land. The boardwalk connects, near the jetty, to the boardwalk along the bay. In fact, this seems to be the land of paved walkways; they’re plentiful. On the way to the jetty, you’ll see lots of sand on the wide beach, which has been reclaimed by pumping ocean floor sand onto the beach. It’s usually about 75 yards to the water, unless there’s been a storm and a lot of erosion, and you can usually see the waves from the boardwalk (in some sections, the sand is high enough to obstruct the view). You will also pass some volleyball nets, and at the end you’ll see an area where there are many volleyball nets and usually many people practicing their beach volleyball skills. There is also a parking lot here, with 3 accessible spaces. The restroom here is accessible, but barely. You can’t close the stall door behind you, if it will close at all, because of the stall’s small depth. The door is a warped plywood board rustily hinged to a 2x4 bolted to the wall. In fact, I forgot to mention that the other restrooms’ stalls are the same. Good enough, I guess, for surfers, who are going to go back out and get washed by the salt water, but I wouldn’t want to have to sit on one of these toilets, and they’re often clogged, at least before they get cleaned. The jetty has the best break on Mission Beach, so this is the place to hang out if you like to watch surfing. Sadly, however, you can’t always see the water from here because the bulldozers sometimes pile up the sand to protect the restrooms (there is no seawall here). There are no public restrooms between Belmont Park and these at the jetty. The new lifeguard station is just a few yards north of this restroom, so if you’re in trouble you may be able to get help there. If we jump back to Belmont Park were we began and head north, we’ll immediately find Draft, which is as much a pub as a restaurant. Think sports bar—huge TVs playing soccer, football, baseball…you get the picture. They have over 60 kinds of draft beer, and the food is decent. The thing to do here, if you’re not into sports, is to have lunch outside and watch the waves and people (the boardwalk is between the buildings and the seawall all along the beach). Draft does brunch on weekends, but don’t quote me on that—call them first because they used to serve breakfast every day until they surprised me by stopping that without telling me, the little sneakers. Above that, we have Cannonball, a sushi restaurant with plexiglass walls facing the beach. These walls protect you from getting chilled by the ocean breeze, but they don’t obstruct the view. There’s a public elevator going up from the sidewalk, with transparent walls so you can be seen accessing one of the best views on the entire beach. A few steps north, there’s a taco shop and a wave simulator that are associated with an elevated (meaning above the level of the beach), feet-in-the-sand snack bar. Surrounding all this, at the amusement park, there are some clothing stores, a surfboard rental, an escape room, and the Giant Dipper, a Coney Island-style, wooden-track rollercoaster. I’ve never tried to ride—the last time I went on a wooden coaster, I nearly fell out. Continuing north, we find the aforementioned, disused lifeguard station—or at least I think it’s disused; it was fenced in; I don’t know if it’s for renovation or demolition. Google Maps has it labeled as “Lifeguard Historical Landmark.” There’s an even nastier restroom in this building—but again, they hose them down every morning. This is where they used to have beach wheelchairs—they’re free to use. Obviously, you’ll now need to call to see where to find these (619-980-1876). They had manual chairs that require a companion to push the chair, and their website at sandiego.gov says they have power and floating beach chairs as well, but I think the power chairs’ availability may be subject to whether those chairs are in working condition. I once checked out one of those power chairs. Thing was cool—it had tracks. Got in it, drove it down to the water, was just starting to enjoy the fact that this was the first time I had ever “walked” on the beach with my wife… And it promptly quit on me. After a few tries, I discovered that it would still go, but only backward. So I went backward all the way up the beach and back to the lifeguard station. Salt air, I guess. You’ll find this information easiest if you call the number or do a Google search for “beach wheelchairs San Diego.” Next, continuing north, we come to Ventura Place, where we see Hamel’s, which used to be one of those scary rides with the cars that go through the building with the flashing lights and zombies that jump out at you, also with the requisite section of track that goes out onto a balcony and back inside—the latter still exists. Today it’s a “beach entertainment shop,” which apparently means clothing store and surfboard and bike rental. But the stony facade still looks like the joy ride from years past, which is fun. Behind Hamel’s, along Ventura Pl., there are restaurants, bars, and beach supply stores. I’d like to mention Kojak’s here, a hole-in-the-wall that serves gyros. They made me a passable souvlaki, though it wasn’t beef the way I was introduced to it—rather, it was the shaved lamb that they put in gyros. (I’m really only mentioning this because I love souvlaki!) All the way down the block at Mission Blvd. and past the sidewalk bar and several other shops, is a taco shop with a walk-up (or roll-up in our case) window if you really want to get “beachy.” From here, it’s 1.5 miles to Crystal Pier on the boardwalk, so go to the yucky restroom before you start this trek because there are no restrooms unless you go inside one of the few wheelchair accessible restaurants, such as World Famous, or one of the hotels a half-block inland on Strandway, which is kind of an alley for parking access. (Is World Famous world famous? Who knows? But they serve seafood, and they have outdoor seating with shower curtains for wimps who want to dine “alfresco” without bringing enough clothes to keep themselves warm!) Along the way, you’ll see ice cream parlors, hot dog stands, and kitsch shops. If you get lucky, you’ll even get to see the tall, scrawny guy who wears a g-string and a shark fin and nothing else, whooshing by on his roller skates. Many if not most of these businesses are not wheelchair accessible. There is a step up into almost all of them. There’s a beer joint along the way with a big deck that has a ramp up to get you there. That deck is about house-high, though, so be prepared. Near the Crystal pier, after you’ve passed lots of houses, shops, and beach motels, you’ll come across the Baja Beach Cafe, another restaurant with outdoor seating and no roof (so no shower curtains). They serve what you’d expect: short-order fare with a Mexican flavor, plus margaritas. Near the end of our journey, you’ll reach Crystal Pier. There are cottages for rent right on the pier at Crystal Pier Hotel and Cottages. A quick phone call to their office revealed that they have two accessible cottages. You can park your vehicle right on the pier next to your cottage. There are studios, one-, and two-bedroom cottages. They have a two-night minimum stay in the winter and a three-night minimum in the summer. Four-night minimum on major holidays. You can also stroll to the end of the pier without being a guest at the cottages. Up the hill and past the restrooms is the much more modern Tower 23 hotel for those who don’t have time for, or are not into, the 1930s flavor of the Cottages. They have ADA-accessible rooms. All rooms have a balcony (or patio in the case of first-floor rooms) with an ocean view. Caveat: “Ocean view” in hotel parlance means you can see the ocean from your room—not that you are looking straight out at the ocean—you’ll have to ask for oceanfront if you want to look directly out onto the ocean. The hotel is U-shaped, so some of these rooms look out onto the pool, and you can see the ocean in the background or on your left or right. This hotel is going to be more pricey than the Cottages. There are several more hotels farther up the hill, but I have to stop somewhere, so I’m not going mention them. A quick search in Google Maps will reveal them. By the time you’ve reached this point (you’re now in Pacific Beach), if you’ve done the entire circuit, you will have gone about 1.5 miles. It may be lunchtime. What to eat? Depends on what you want, of course, and there are even a few restaurants inland on Mission Blvd. My choice would be the Baja Beach Cafe because I love to eat outdoors. Keep in mind, though, that it’s a mile-and-a half back to your car, so you may want to try not to drink too many margaritas with lunch. Going back to your car, you’ll probably want to backtrack instead of seeing what’s on Mission Blvd. My experience has been that there’s not much there but houses, nothing very touristy, and that the driveways are steeply sloped toward the street. The sidewalks are in need of repair, too, so you’ll find lots of cracks and crevices. But if you want to feel like you’re in a beach city, this street will definitely do the job. There’s a Ralph’s grocery along the way, along with a CVS Pharmacy. You’ll also pass the Catamaran Resort Hotel, a four-star hotel with ocean and bay views from the upper floors. They have a small dock on the bay, where you can rent a sailboat or catamaran. (This is also possible at the Bahia resort, farther inland.) Who knows? You may find some hole-in-the-wall that I don’t know about—I’m not a local there, I’ve just visited many times— that boardwalk is one of my favorite rolls. Once you’re back to your car, it’s not far to the freeways. I should also mention here the Hyatt Regency Mission Bay, where we’ve stayed many times. This hotel is also upscale. They have ocean and bay view rooms. The view from either side is excellent, but the ocean side can be noisy because that’s also where the pool and wedding venues are—you want the upper floors if you can get them. They also have ADA-accessible rooms, but we have never rented one since we prefer the mild hardship that comes with a higher floor and an ocean view. (I have an able-bodied wife, as you may have surmised—their beds are sky-high!). Their on-site restaurant, the Red Marlin, seems to be currently in a state of flux—they’ve changed management, and the last time I visited, they only had a buffet breakfast instead of the buffet and full-service. I hate trying to navigate a buffet from my wheelchair while balancing a plate of food on my lap—not to mention the freshness of buffet food. They’re closed for lunch, but there is a short-order restaurant, Pelican’s on the Bay, poolside. Room service is more like having take-out delivered. Dinner at the Red Marlin is good but pricey. You can, however, sit outside on their patio by the fire (they have propane heaters, too) or inside looking out at the marina or the bay through their large picture windows. Across W. Mission Bay Dr., right next to another marina, at the Dana on Mission Bay (this is an old motel that’s received a glow-up, and there is a new building, too) is a nice little place called Firefly. Most of their tables are outdoors on an artificial turf surface near (but not beside) their pool. You can also roll there from the Hyatt, along another of the plentiful paved walkways in the area, without crossing W. Mission Bay Dr. You’ll go under the bridge, along the bay, and see the sailboats and the other boats. Speaking of the walkways, this area is worth some Street View research in Google Maps. The walkways are in the app—you can travel them virtually! Most of the entire Bay in this area is ringed with walkways. When we were a little younger, my wife and I spent entire days walking along these walkways and never retracing our path. If you want to spend time outdoors at the ocean, you can’t go wrong at Mission Beach. It’s not 100% wheelchair accessible, but where does that exist? There’s plenty to do, plenty to see, and plenty of sun, but it doesn’t get excessively hot. There are fishing and whale watching tours that leave from the marina by the Hyatt. It goes without saying that there are also plenty of hotels nearby, and tons of stuff to do in San Diego, from the San Diego Zoo (a world-class zoo) to the Old Globe Theater. There’s also the Gaslight District and Seaport Village. And if you need public transportation, that’s available, too. We have taken the trolley from the Hyatt to downtown with little trouble. My impression is that all of the public transportation is wheelchair accessible—it’s California, after all. So what are you waiting for?

On check-in we received Rm #'s C-1, C-2 C-12. At check-in I asked which was the accessible one and was told we did not have the accessible room that we requested and there were no others available. He gave us the C-12 saying it was a bigger room so I could move around in it and had a walk-in shower. Room size was very good for WC use except could not get in the bathroom area due to narrow doorway. The walk-in shower wasn't. It had about a 5"" step up and no handrails or seat. Toilet was usual contractor toilet with a low seat. Used a chair to be able to get up and down safely. The walkway to the room was heavily obstructed by bush. Attache is 2 pics of the walkway with one showing me deep into the vegetation to get to and from the room. 1 Pic of the door. It had a door stop that constantly fell down necessitating us to have to reach down to lift only to fall again. We taped it up several times only to have it come untapped to due to hard door closing and was also very hard to enter due to very heavy tension on door closer. As for C-1 AC didn't' work properly.

1515,"From a community member: I have been doing a lot of research about accessibility in travelling and have not found a way to take my daughter on the trips that she wants. My daughter has severe arthrogryposis affecting all of her joints below the neck. She cannot use her arms or her legs. Her legs are fixed straight, both knees and ankles are fixed in place. Her wheelchair has an extension that supports her legs in front of her. The sides of the extension open up to allow her legs to spread to the sides when she is not moving. Her hips are adducted outward and her shoulders are abducted inward; part of the arthrogryposis. If her legs are contained straight for long periods of time her knees can become sprained due to the push outward from the hips. Her elbows, wrists and finger joints are also fixed. She cannot use her arms or her hands. She is prone to fractures is she falls or bumped hard. We did travel when she was younger and I could carry her onto a plane and sit her in the bulkhead seat. As she is grown now we travel in our accessible Sienna and bring her Hoyer and commode with us. The difficulty is when she wants to travel further. She dreams of going to Europe. She want to see Amsterdam, Wales and England. She also wants to travel to Los Angeles, California. She now weighs over 200 pounds and I can no longer lift or carry her.

223,"Finding a budget friendly hotel in central London was not easy. I settled on the Z Hotel Covent Garden as it was in the heart of it all. If you are into theatre it is very convenient. It is located among tons of great shopping, world class (free) museums, subway (tube) lines, and great restaurants. There are other Z Hotel locations in the city. As you can tell the location is it’s #1 best feature. The 2nd would be the staff. We arrived with a broken wheelchair, 3 suitcases and a tearful old lady. The staff went out of their way to be helpful. They made calls to help us find repairs and replacement services. They got our room ready much earlier than their 3 pm norm. But then we have the rooms. Remember that huge rooms are an American thing not European. But for wheelchair users space is a need, not a want. I can say that we fit, but barely. The bed was tucked into an alcove, so one person was wedged into the wall and had to climb over to get a middle of the night pee. Of course that wakes up the sleeping person too. A lift can be used in the room. There is an electric kettle and coffees and teas were stocked well. A great feature was the bathroom. It had a grab bar on the left side, tp on the right at a good height, roll under sink, roll in shower with a seat in the shower. It was spacious. They have a cafe on the main floor. But the Pasta Brown restaurant just next door was better. Unfortunately, there is a step to get up to get into Pasta Brown. All told it is a good enough place if you can get through the quirks.

92,"Miami International Airport will begin installing wheelchair lifts on its jet bridges next week, in a move aimed at improving accessibility for passengers with reduced mobility. The first phase of the rollout will cover 41 gates across all three terminals. The new technology will streamline the boarding process for travelers who use wheelchairs and is part of a broader $9 billion modernization plan called Future-Ready MIA. “These upgrades are about building an airport that works for everyone,” said Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, who called the initiative a reflection of the region’s values of inclusion and innovation. Beyond the lifts, the airport plans to replace 94 of its 126 jet bridges by 2028. Renovations will also upgrade more than 200 public restrooms and over 600 conveyances like elevators and escalators. American Airlines, MIA’s largest operator, supports the improvements, which are expected to ease congestion at one of the nation’s busiest hubs. Though some facilities will temporarily close during construction, airport officials say the end result will be a more efficient, inclusive experience for the 55 million passengers Miami serves each year.

1545,"# UNITED STATES V. UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. Hi everyone, Pinky 🧚 again. I wanted to share with you some goof news I just discovered while on the Department of Justice’s website. If anyone has had issues with Uber and/or have been charged for the extra time needed to board the accessible vehicles; it looks like our day of reckoning is coming, as the DOJ comes to our defense finally. (Now if someone could just explain to me why Uber killed its Accessible vehicle programs in ALL but a couple of cities in the U.S.? Love to get everyone’s feedback on the case or if you have had any issues with Uber, Lyft, or any of the transportation apps? Thanks everyone; I look forward to reading your posts,-Pinky 🧚 Https://www.justice.gov/crt/case/united-states-v-uber-technologies-inc Overview: On November 10, 2021, the United States filed a complaint under Title III of the ADA challenging Uber’s practice of charging “wait time” fees to passengers who, because of disability, take longer than two minutes to get in their Uber car. Passengers with disabilities may need additional time to enter a car for various reasons. A passenger may, for example, use a wheelchair or walker that needs to be broken down and stored in the car. Or a passenger who is blind may need additional time to safely walk from the pickup location to the car itself. If you believe you have been a victim of disability discrimination by Uber because you, or someone you were traveling with, were charged wait time fees, please contact the Justice Department at 833-591-0425 (toll-free), 202-305-6786, or send an email to Uber.Fee@usdoj.gov. On February 4, 2022, the United States filed a response to Uber’s Motion to Dismiss the Complaint, arguing that, contrary to Uber’s arguments, Uber is a covered transportation company under Title III of the ADA and that the United States’ Complaint plausibly alleges that Uber violates Title III of the ADA and its implementing regulations by charging discriminatory wait time fees to people with disabilities who, because of disability, need more than two minutes to board an Uber vehicle. On July 18, 2022, the Department of Justice announced that it entered a multi-million-dollar settlement agreement with Uber Technologies, Inc. to resolve a the lawsuit. Under the agreement, Uber will offer millions of dollars in compensation to over 65,000 Uber riders who were charged the discriminatory fees due to a disability. Uber will also waive wait time fees for all Uber riders who certify that they (or someone they frequently travel with) need more time to get in an Uber because of a disability, and will ensure that refunds are easily available for anyone who is charged a wait time fee because of disability.

104,"Cruise post There are so many different accessibility needs, so I will describe our situation and where this cruise met our needs or failed. My husband had a hemorrhagic stroke 2.5 years ago and is hemiplegic - no ability to use left side, and the left side of each eye is blind. He is in a power wheelchair full-time. We are 73. I am active and mobile and his care partner. At home he transfers chair/bed by standing at a tension bar. On the road, either with slide board or Hoyer lift. For toileting, always Hoyer lift. For this trip I brought our Hoyer lift and an extra manual wheelchair that I push. I’m sorry about the extreme detail, but different people will want to know different info. The Room: We took the same trip a year ago and had room 9922. This year we had room 14878. Both are ADA rooms and have the same perfect layout. Large bathroom - I could easily use the Hoyer lift to take my husband to the toilet or shower. The toilet had a left wall grab bar, and a right fold down (very strong) grab bar. The shower has a seat that lowers from the wall, extremely strong and sturdy. The grab bar was on the left which doesn’t work for my husband, but the water control bar was directly in front and mounted safely enough to use for support. There was also a vertical grab bar on the left and my husband’s arm was long enough to reach. I don’t know if there are any rooms that are mirror images so we’d get right bars. The room itself is large enough to maneuver around. A Hoyer lift will fit under the bed, but look first so you can reposition the life jackets stored there. To use the slide board in a way that he can help, he needs always to move right, so in the morning, I need to back the wheelchair all the way to the wall. (He sleeps on the left). That required moving the bed 8” from its normal position to make room and I was able to do that on my own. The end tables are easy to move so after he’s in bed, I put one next to his arm and put a towel (to prevent slippage) and urinals on top so he can use them at night. There’s a desk with room to roll under. There was a hair dryer under the desk that reached to the bed to help with morning cleaning. There was plenty of storage. I kept the Hoyer in the shower, and the folded extra wheelchair in the closet, and the power chair next to the desk where it could charge and be out of the way if I needed to get up at night. These rooms have aft balconies, which are large and have no threshold entries. Imagine the tapering shape of the ship - the 9th deck balcony is enormous; the 14th is normal sized. Also 9th is quieter. There was often outdoor music and dancing 10-midnight on the 15th deck which we could hear. Ship activities: We are not typical cruisers. We like to sit or stroll outdoors, read, and relax. I did the ropes course which was scary but fun, and last year I went on the aqua slide. We don’t do games, casino, etc, so get that info from someone else. Meals: The buffet: Some seats are helpfully labeled as handicap. There is no difference, but they are located near broad hallways making it easy to get in and out. We took advantage of this. It’s too hectic for a person in a wheelchair to use the buffet, so I had to do all the choosing and serving, but the selection was very broad so we typically went there for breakfast and lunch. At “rush hour” servers will bring you drinks so that makes things easier. The dining rooms: When we entered I mentioned the wheelchair and the waiters tried for easy in/easy out seating. Moving around: Because of my husband’s limited vision, he drives very, very slowly which means people cross in front and back which is safe but doesn’t feel it to him. He has sensory issues, so the constant people/noise/music made it harder. There are plenty of elevators and people were always patient about him getting in and out and turning. There are plenty of accessible bathrooms and they are large enough for turning around. Excursions: DO NOT TAKE THE NCL WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE TOUR OF THE ISLAND!!! It was SO bad and expensive and I’m still angry that they won’t compensate me for any of the cost. The mini-bus had a reasonable rear elevator entry, but because of the number of people, instead of lift and drive forward into place in the back, the driver manually moved the wheelchair all the way to the right, and a scooter all the way to the left. This could not be done by driving either vehicle, because the last row of the bus was too close. This was dangerous and risked harming the chair. It meant if my husband wanted to get out at any of the stops it would take 10-15 minutes each way, so of course he never left the bus. There were many people with accessibility needs, no place to put equipment and no time built into the trip for extra in/out help. So we ran late, and when we got to the final stop, St. George’s, where I thought we’d get out and eat lunch at a pub, there was only 25 minutes left, so I ran to a grocery and we ate in the bus. AND, the lift was not secured tightly and banged the whole drive so conversation was impossible. There was not enough of interest IMHO on the drive, so I’d recommend taking the free ferry to St. George’s, which is accessible. The excursion I planned: My husband is an avid birder and there is a very rare bird, the Bermuda Petrel, that nests on Nonsuch Island, and spends the rest of its life at sea. Longtail Tours - Lynn Thorne - longtail.tours@gmail.com . Lynn arranged for an accessible taxi to take us to Tucker Town Wharf, a charter boat to take us to Nonsuch Island, where Jeremy Madeiros, principle scientist, dept of Environment and Natural Resources, brought 3 chicks to the boat that we could hold while he weighed, measured, and banded them. An incredible experience that went perfectly smoothly. The taxi was Paradise Transit Ltd, Alton Trott, trottalton@gmail.com . 441-705-9198. Rear lift, easy in/out, lovely, helpful guy. The charter boat was Castaway Charters Chase Sleeter 441-505-0855 We planned for a 2-hour period at high tide when the dock and the boat would be level. I used the manual wheelchair so the extra weight was 30 pounds not 250. Chase was wonderful - confident getting the chair on and off and securing. The experience was unbelievable. I recommend all these people if you have accessibility needs and do your own planning. That’s all. Hope this helps someone. Feel free to ask me questions.",pet handicap,1,1,0,0,0,0,disputed

1691,"Hi everyone! It’s Pinky 🧚 , one of your Forum Moderators here at AccessibleGo. I’m not one to be a big product pusher, but I was reading a copy of NewMobility (free magazine from United Spinal) in the car today and saw something that made my eyes pop out. Now I know you are all going to tell me I am the last one on the planet to know about these, but there has to be at least 1 or 2 others who haven’t, right? Lets just pretend there is and I promise try and stay more on top of the cool gear releases. Have you by chance heard of the Go-Anywhere Chairs? 💺 They make some of the coolest shower and commode chairs that I think are Fabulous! Especially the Go-Anywhere Commode, Shower 'n Tub Chair that would help you convert any bathtub when you travel to being accessible (ok… minus the missing support bars and wide doorways), But if you happen to only need to solve the shower and commode part when traveling, you really should check this out. Plus it even has a great little suitcase you can get to fold it into for travel; and don’t forget that almost all airlines will fly any of your needed medical/accessibility luggage for FREE. (check ahead because some airline ask you to inform them ahead of time of how many bags you will check and some just wait till you arrive at airport.) If you check out the webpage, you will notice they make several different designs based on what your needs might be; but it looks like they all will fold up into that same size travel bag 💼 , which is amazing. Now I know the prices may look a little scary, but they do provide some links to ways to help with funding if your insurance does not cover it. However, they are a Canadian 🇨🇦 company and not all of the funding suggestions will be applicable if you don’t live there (but they don’t all say you have to be Canadian to apply either). There are lots of programs you can find online in the United States and other countries to help as well. If your insurance covers “Durable Medical Goods”, just make sure your doctor writes you a prescription that specifically lists the brand and model name of the chair you want on it; and that you specifically need that exact chair, no replacements. Then you usually submit the script to your insurance companies’ durable goods office and they try and find a vendor they already use (3rd party), to order the chair for you. If they can’t find one their vendors who can buy it, they may tell you to just purchase and submit receipt for reimbursement. It sounds like a tedious process, but usually they have a time limit to try and find; so have faith. Follow up with them if its been a couple of weeks; they may have just forgotten to call you back. 📲 Thank you everyone for listening to my pitch for the chairs 🙏 , I promise I won’t do this very often unless I see something that I truly believe would making travel easier for everyone. You know me, I just want everyone to get out and see the world; even if it takes a bit of extra effort to travel. Please…if anyone has any of the chairs from this company, share with us on the forum what you think and how/if they made your travel any easier?Or if you also know of good travel shower-commode chairs, tell us all what worked best for you?

1173,"After several years of being bound to a mechanical(mech.) wheelchair(wc), we finally had the means to drive to NYC. We were excited to finally make it to NYC. I use to live in NYC before having to use a mech. wc, pre-2001. I am familiar with the area. We had no experience staying, asking or knowing what exactly is a mobility accessible room. I started looking for hotels in the beginning of this year for an April trip. After months researching, searching, booking, and reserving, I learned that:-a room’s square footage is important in my case but in NYC, unless you have the means, the square footage can be limited.-not every accessible room is really accessible. That is difficult to know but the square footage can be a guideline.-third party apps. & hotel chains’ 1 800 customer service #s for an accessible room can be dicey. Its best to communicate with the property.-it’s almost impossible to find any type of parking for an accessible van.-there is a disconnection for the room needed between hotel chains, properties & third party apps. When problems arise, it can become a frustrating, headache, a kind of pass the hot potato between those three. After months of searching, researching, & reserving for an accessible mobility room, we found the perfect place. For the room we needed, the price, the customer service from the property, we stayed in Hilton Brooklyn in downtown Brooklyn with close to 500 square feet of hotel room.The excellent customer service, a shout out to Isabela, & the square footage is what sold us.The bathroom was spotless & I was able to move around the room with my chair easily.Bartender was friendly and received great customer service.We had breakfast there. I was impressed at the quality of the meal.The room is quiet. You cant hear the traffic or the next room. It’s easy to get to some of the best beer in NYC.The hotel is walking distance to Juniors, DUMBO, & other must go places.The city’s bus drivers are friendly, and accommodate nicely. It’s easy to get the ferry & head to other boroughs. The subways are not useful for mechanical wheelchair users. If you do your homework before going, you can get discounted mass transportation & free rides for your PCA. If you go the extra mile, if need be, you can apply for a NYC visitor’s parking permit which can be very beneficial. Managing the chair’s charge is important. I learned to carry mine & charge it.

My plan would also be to rent a beach wheelchair. I appreciate any recommendations you can provide.,child handicap,1,0,1,1,0,0,disputed

Based on my research, I’ve seen that Peggy’s Cove is kind of a big deal, but is roughly an hour from the port. I’m sailing into the port in late May, but I will be alone, and everything the cruise line is giving me options of require a travel companion to deal with my scooter. I can manage it, but don’t want to spend the day taking it apart and putting it together again :) Anyone with experience and thoughts? Thanks, Lon",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

I have read reviews of hotel accessibility, sounds like most have roll-in showers and lower bed height for transfer. I am looking for suggestions on Hotel/Caninos with these priorities in mind: Roll-in showers Low bed height Casinos having a more open, less crowded feeling, smoke free if possible. We will not have a car so a good location is important. Looking forward to feedback from some of you who can help. Thank you so much.Dave",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

390,"I know others have asked about travel scooters previously but looking for a few more suggestions or personal experiences, if possible. I have had several travel scooters over the years. Previously I always had ones with four wheels and it didn’t matter how much it weighed as much because I was married and my ex husband would typically be there on long trips. I am now a single mom and while my kids are getting stronger they aren’t always with me when I go on trips and I have to rely on others for help. In the past year my newest scooter, which only has three wheels, and is much lighter, has allowed me to travel easier and get around in hotel rooms a bit better as well. The issue I am having is that it has tipped over with me on it 3 or 4 times in the last year with me on it. It always tips to the left right onto my leg that is amputated and left hip. I’m so scared that I will end up breaking something like my hip if it keeps happening. I’m about 150 lbs so should be under the weight capacity. It has happened when going from a sidewalk to the grass, grass to sidewalk, going up a hill and on a bumpy lawn leaving a barn wedding. I try to not let my disability keep me from trying to go places but now I get really anxious anytime there isn’t a paved even path. Anyone have suggestions?",child handicap,1,0,1,0,0,1,disputed
250,"I am 68 and my wife is 65, both disabled without mobility issues. We attempt to stay in shape and use the stairs whenever we are on the ship. Two of our last cruises were on Koningsdam (24 days) and Rotterdam (16 days). We found the cruisers that acted the most entitled and rude on the ship to be those with scooters. They parked them where ever they wanted, near stairs, elevators, in the hall way outside of their cabins. Even saw some parked in front of automatic fire doors. I complained to the guest services, the hotel manager and even the captain. Since none of them took action I wrote certified letters to the President of Holland America, CEO of Carnival and the Chairman of the Board stating that the crew of their vessels were not enforcing the corporate policy or U.S. Coast Guard policy in regard to mobility devices. In the event of a serious emergency these devices and the people that require them are a safety hazard to the rest of the passengers. I received a letter back from the President of Holland America. He stated that they took safety very serious and that they would start enforcing the corporate policy. He went on to say they had a team of 16 people that would go around and help those who used mobility devices in an emergency. Think about it, there are far more folks using mobility devices on Holland America cruise ships than the 16 crew members would be able to help. If a person is so disabled they can't help themselves and pose a risk to other passenger or the crew they should stay home. I will get a lot of flak from people, but if you think about it I am correct on this subject.",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

Wheelchair Tables: All I have seen are for at-home use, BUT wonder if anyone thought of manufacturing one out of Plastic/Perspex that is unbreakable but folds in half to fit into a travel hold all and is light enough not to add any significant weight. I travel with a tour company but have had the embarrassment of dropping my Breakfast Plate on the floor in front of my new fellow passengers as being a one leg amputee with no right leg, hip or pelvis balancing a plate to the table is a disaster. I would love to be able to take a tray on tour so i can use it as and when and wondered if that was possible.
