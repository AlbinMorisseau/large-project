The room was spacious and well appointed. It was loud in the morning with breakfast in the lobby and housekeeping starts knocking at 8am sharp. They'll keep knocking too which was irritating so if you want to sleep past 8 put the privacy card on your door handle. Breakfast ends at 10 which I wasn't told at check-in and didn't see in writing anywhere so we missed that the first day.

It's reasonably priced with top quality selection and service. The terrace view is calming with all the trees and water fountains babbling in the background.The pool was just 'remodeled' for memorial weekend but as always it was over packed and there were about 15 chaise lounge chairs for a large hotel. The hotel must buy some chairs for the clients. We had to sit on the concrete both days with our 2 year old. Next time we will bring our own chairs.I talked to the staff who said the entire hotel is in a remodel phase and I'm sure they will address these minor details.

Their directions on the ways you have to use the room key in the elevator and room were not very clear. We heard that over and over again as we went up and down the elevator with other visitors. The room had strange windows that looked out to the hotel interior. We missed having a window to do a quick weather check. The bathroom was spacious but had the most non-ergonomic faucet. Turning it on meant bumping your hand on the lighted mirror above the sink and that was unpleasant. All the elevators stopped working at one point and the staff only offered a free bottle of water despite the significant challenge for the hotel visitors. I observed a person in a wheel chair as one example. No help was offered for getting yourself or luggage to and from the lobby (besides a free bottle of water from the lobby shop). Although sometimes things happen, it is how the staff responds and this was a major disappointment. The free shuttle will take you up to 1 mile away if it is available or you can wait.

1090,"I went to Chicago last weekend for the Ryder Cup (Golf Tournament) and everywhere I usually stay was completely booked! Rooms were going for crazy rates, so I started seeking out some options that were 'off the beaten path'. I discovered the Central Loop Hotel, and I knew where it was, as I used to walk by it from time to time when I still lived in Chicago.The hotel is very well kept, and has cheap valet (34/night with in-and-out access!). THe check in process was a little strange to me because you check in using a machine like you would at the airport. Some people might love this - but i missed talking to a real person. The machine printed my room info and key card and I headed up to my 6th floor corner room.This room was perfect for my needs. Very comfortable bed, sparkling white linens, beautiful widows that overlooked some fantastic Chicago architecture (post office). But - this room was TINY! Again, it was just me and I knew I would only be spending time in my room sleeping, but the bathroom was very small (no tub, shower only) and the closet was tiny. Almost felt like a ship's quarters. If you are going as a couple, or even attempting to bring kids I would def. upgrade to a larger room or suite. The rooms have free wifi (yeah!), lots of cable channels, free in room coffee and a friendly concierge staff.

1495,"We stayed here for a trip to Disneyland. The good: 1 bedroom suite was very large. The bedroom area was small but the living area was huge. Great working/desk area and very nice kitchenette with a nearly full sized refrigerator, small stove, microwave, etc. Some things were recently renovated and looked very nice. The staff was great, helpful and friendly. Location was great, lots of stuff nearby, on the ART route to Disney and close to freeways. Breakfast was small but a decent selection - the waffles were really good and they had trays so that you could take food back to your room. The bad: some parts of the hotel have not been renovated, so there is a mix of new/nice and old/run down in the same room (i.e bathroom counters were nice, but the rest of the bathroom was dated. Old dresser in the bedroom, but tv's were nicer. The carpeting was old, and the door to the room was worn and actually had some non matching paint spots covering some type of damage, but the kitchenette was very nice as was the desk area and newer cabinets that were part of the desk area. For having a large living space, there wasn't a lot of seating. So, there was a small sofabed, and a table with just one chair. It would be nice to have the table and 4 chairs so that if multiple people are in the room (a standard family) there would be places to sit as the couch would only really fit 2-3 people. the other bad was that while I booked the room using Marriott points and was told that they would only place a 40 hold for incidentals on my credit card, the system automatically puts a hold for 170 for each night of your stay, unless the clerk removes your card info and overrides the system. I didn't know this until i looked online at my credit card account. Fortunately, Sam at the front desk was great and got the hold for the first night removed and made sure that no hold was placed on the 2nd night. Still though, unsettling to have some unexpected holds on your account. I've never had that happen at any other marriott property. I also had trouble connecting to the wifi, it kept giving me an error that I couldn't log into the wifi with my room number and last name. But, it actually still connected me on all devices I tried, so I just ignored the error and it worked just fine.Martha C.Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate.

I had reserved a room with a queen size bed through Expedia, but was given a room with two twin beds instead. The excuse: they ran out of bedspreads for queen size beds (how lame is that). 2) The elevator was unreliable. After checking in, myself and another guest were stuck on the first floor because of a malfunctioning card-reader in the elevator. The front desk staffperson fortunately was able to jiggle her card in a way that prompted the elevator to start moving. Not a good sign.3) The room reminded me of a depressing college dorm room. 4) The staff have no concept of customer service. On a prior visit, the staff were not willing to make any accomodations for a late checkout (even 15 minutes after the official checkout time - truly Kafkaesque).

Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager",child,0,0,1,0,0,0,disputed

1772,"If you're not a Seattle veteran, you need to know that there are 3 main downtown neighborhoods. The old city by Pioneer Square in the south, the heart of downtown near the Pike Place market, and the northern neighborhood near the Seattle Center (Space Needle). While the heart of downtown has traditionally been the best neighborhood for tourists to stay in, the ongoing revitalization of the Seattle Center area has somewhat shifted this equation. Personally, for tourist purposes, I like the Seattle Center neighborhood just as much -- primarily because it's a little less corporate, a little more casual, and has ready access to many of the best museums (like the EMP across the street from the Hyatt). It's also only a 20 minute walk to the Pike Place market from the Hyatt House, and they offer a complimentary shuttle service, too.In this context, the Hyatt House is a grear place to stay if you're OK with the Seattle Center location. The hotel is new, and has a nice modern vibe. Since it's an extended stay brand, rooms at the Hyatt House are large. For this particular location, they also made them stylish. As a Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum member, my family was upgraded to an extremely comfortable one-bedroom suite facing the Space Needle. Breakfast is well above average for a free hotel breakfast, My only complaint was that the omelette maker was completely overwhelmed, and it could take more than a half hour to get an omelette (the buffet food had no delays). It's a nice touch to offer omelettes, but it doesn't work unless they can be made efficiently.The shuttle bus can also be a bit of a mixed blessing. In rush hour traffic, the service can be quite slow. I'd recommend walking to downtown during peak periods.Dave'sreviews,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay.

Shortly after we got to the room I picked up the remote to turn on the TV and found the back cover for the batteries was missing. I pressed the power button on the remote and the TV did not turn on, thinking that because the cover was missing it was the batteries. I removed the batteries and put them back in but that did not work. I then tried to turn on the TV directly and still no power. After tracing the power cable I found that it was unplugged. The power cable would not reach the wall outlet so I plugged it in to the desk lamp on the counter next to the TV.

879,"Bad: Nothing to dislike at all!. Good: As a first time visitor to Chicago, the hotel was an excellent central location from which to explore. Firstly, the property, services, cleanliness, wifi and staff were very good. As mentioned by other users, there is a continental buffet served on a credenza on each floor outside the elevators from around 6.30 am. Some may want a more sumptuous offering, but this is a very generous continental breakfast and would be more than sufficient for most. Travelling to the hotel from O'Hare was simple. If you can read and follow English signs, it's an easy and cheap transition on the Blue Line public train into town. The hotel website gives precise information on which stop to disembark and the 5-10 minute walk to the property. Probably a better option to use taxis, Uber etc if you are travelling with lots of luggage or you have mobility issues. As for food and entertainment, the hotel is surrounded by excellent options. Restaurants and bars of all types abound. The House of Blues is right across the road for example. River Walk is also a highlight and is only a 3 minute walk away. The hotel area is well serviced by public transport and taxis, plus the first stop of Hop On/Hop Off Bus tour company is 5 minutes away in front of the Trump Building. As in other cities and countries that offer this service, it's an excellent way to get a quick feel for a new place, and Chicago is a stunning place to visit. By the way, Buddy Guy's Legends Bar is well worth a visit. People will always have various expectations, but I found the staff, service, amenities, and most of all the music on the night, to be fabulous as a musician and huge blues fan, this was a big tick on my personal bucket list.

First, let me say if youre a snob and really into posh places with fancy marble lobby floors, fluffy robes on the hook, perky concierge behind a big desk, etc. this may not be for you. But if you like to get real value, service and comfortable accommodations for a modest price, you cannot beat the Inn at the Vines. It is family owned and operated (several generations), and the service and sense of community are notable in this day and age. The place has been updated and has all the features you need..clean well furnished rooms, flat screens, very comfortable beds (we had king bed rooms), great towels, and organic soaps. To some earlier reviews about highway noise: we found it minimal and no one in our group complained. Yes, I did hear the occasional truck early in the morning or California kid with a Flowmaster exhaust doing a jack-rabbit start from the intersectionagain it was not a problem. Ask for a room in the back of the hotel. Front Desk Manager Shanirra did an exceptional job booking our customized winery tour, restaurant reservations, and balloon rides. As our person on the ground in Napa she was in our corner every step of the way and played a large part of a successful three days in Napa! At the front desk Melody, Shawn and Bertha were always helpful, upbeat and service-minded. Complimentary hotel breakfasts are a joke at many hotels.not so at the Inn at the Vines. There is a Dennys on the property, and you get a legitimate complimentary hot breakfast at the restaurant not some dinky room off the lobby. Try eggs any way you want, bacon/sausage and pancakes/toast and coffee. You cant beat it unless you must have Eggs Benedict and mimosas. The owners are continuously making improvements to keep up with newer hotels. During out stay a fitness center and business center were under construction. Botom line: when visiting Napa in the future I will stay at the Inn at the Vines again. Our entire group was pleased.Ed,it was a pleasure meeting you and hosting your group for your stay in the Napa Valley. I enjoyed hearing your story of what happened at the Castle. Yes, Shanirra is a great employee who is always the first to try out new restaurants and tours. All of our employees keep up to date on all there is to do in the Valley.

Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled.

The rooms have recently been renovated with an updated dcor. The rooms are very spacious and we have never had a problem with noise. The pool never seems crowded. The food is average. Sunrise breakfast for 3.99 in the caf, but you have to know about it as it is not on the menu. We are members of their BConnected players program and do receive the occasional perk, however be aware that anything you win ie. breakfast buffets, have to be used the following day. Other casinos vouchers are good for a longer period of time. Years ago I used to win money or break even, not so for the past few years. We had an issue with our bill at check-out, as we do every year. Someone had visited a bar and charged it to our room. The front desk gal said she'd look into it and within an hour was corrected. My only negative comment is how unwilling they are to satisfy a customer issue. Tried to use buffet coupons one day after expiration. We were told to go to the players club and see about getting comps...were told NO. We had a 15.00 food credit on the room which apparently was only good for that particular date (we used it the day before) and upon check-out was charged to the room. I explained that we were not told it could only be used for that particular date as our stay was for more that one day. NO credit. Very poor customer service considering the size of Boyd properties. Pretty sure 15.00 isn't going to break them and I don't like feeling cheated. This will definitely be a deciding factor for our next trip. Plenty of places to choose from when visiting Las Vegas.

They changed the name on the reservation, they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from 109 to 129 We booked in Oct but 1st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodel...but the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked. Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck. There was 4 or 6 couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lot.Our 1st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess, floorboards missing, walls messed up, the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc. I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etc.It was late about 10:30 and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming. So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat. He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other building.We do and its a bigger mess then the 1st building. There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too, the 2nd building is old,smells and needs remodel bad. The new room is 2 bedroom but its hit and miss, way to much furniture, kitchen is dated, microwave falling down, dusty and dirty and about a 3 gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wanted.When we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the 1st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel.

As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property: however, we always have a manager on duty.As we are currently undergoing renovations, we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests. We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay. My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stay.Im happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room. We are sorry that you declined it. My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed. The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred. In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving. As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet. As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made. Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable. We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that. As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests.

1076,"Stayed here twice in the past 2 weeks. Accessible room both times. First the bad - I called the hotel within 45 minutes of checking out - very early morning. I realized I had left my ring on the table next to the bed and asked if they could please check on it immediately. They promised to call me back - they never did. Due to my early checkout and my prompt call, I doubt the cleaning staff had even entered the room. So, I'm very unhappy about the ring - nothing overly expensive, but it did have some sentimental value.Accessible rooms themselves were much more adequate than most - we have a lot of experience in this area, and many accessible rooms are NOT truly accessible. For our second stay we were given a room that was on the top floor and the furthest room from the elevator. In an emergency, we would have never gotten out of that hotel. My husband is in a wheelchair. There is no way we would have made it down 9 flights of stairs, and trying to get 2 children and a manual wheelchair to the elevator was tiring and difficult. WHY don't hotels use a little common sense and realize that accessible rooms on LOWER floors would be more logical We were offered no assistance with luggage either stay.A huge plus for this hotel is that they are one of the very few hotels in Philadelphia that offer 2 Queen beds in a room. However, I was told by the front desk staff that none of the Queen rooms face the street. So, the windows in these rooms basically face other 'inside' rooms and offer very little light. The hotel is fairly new, so the rooms do not have the tired and worn appearance that many hotels in Philadelphia do.Location for this hotel is very good. Very close to Jefferson University Hospital, Chinatown, Magee Rehabilitation hospital, restaurants, city hall, etc. Breakfast leaves a lot to be desired, but then again, yogurt, cereal, juice, beats 40+ for a family breakfast at a restaurant each day.

The next day we didn't get any maid service at all! At 6:00 pm, we went downstairs and asked for our own towels. The little market store downstairs was sold out of bottled water for two of our five day stay. Not having water after a long day of city walking was a real disappointment. And there is no easy market or store within walking distance, so we were chugging tap water. Yuck. My son got sick one night, so we hoped for ginger ale or Sprite or something to settle his stomach.

It wasn't a bad experience, and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client, but I wouldn't stay here alone and I wouldn't stay here for a romantic trip.The service was spectacular in the suite, and included a private butler. That said, I don't really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel. The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming. The hotel lobby is small and, for my tastes, uninteresting. It lacks the wow factor. The concierge was very good, but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing (I've been to NYC more than 30 times, but I always ask the basics).For the money, I'd pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm, sumptuous colors and textures (in the larger rooms) or even the Mandarin Oriental.Note - I stayed in this hotel in 2014.Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with us.We are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences, but are glad to read that you enjoyed our team's service.

The hotel was fine overall but there were some small things that bugged me: * The beds were squeaky * The towels were scratchy * Some machinery within a locked area in the bathroom was running and making a lot of noise RIGHT next to the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom, next to the bed where my wife and I slept. It didn't keep me up at night, but it was noticeable. Some good things to make sure you don't think it was all bad: *The hotel's restaurant, Tradewinds, had great food, and it provided good room service AND it was the first time I'd seen room service at a reasonable price. *The hotel is right on the beach, and since it's not in the crowded part of VA beach shore, there's not so many other people to deal with. Also, the hotel is on the shore of VB that is in the Chesapeake Bay, so the water is much calmer than the beach along Atlantic Avenue something to consider if you have young children.",child,0,0,1,0,0,0,disputed

Relatively new, well maintained hotel with large, bright, attactive, spotless, comfortable rooms. We must praise the staff and are greatful for their good natured, spot-on advice. Shawn was on duty when we arrived. She gave us great advice for drives and restaurants (loved Ristorante Allegria) and she even went online to compile a list kid-friendly vineyards. We should also mention Shanirra who was on duty in the daytime. The breakfast included in the price of the room is served in the adjacent Denny's. Food was standard but service was a bit slow. To be fair, it was a very busy weekend. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends and we will certainly stay there again. By the way, I think you can help hotels save money (and maybe get you a better price) by calling them direct rather than useing third party resellers. (like Priceline, Travelocity etc.)Thank you for your review. We strive to give the best customer service possible to make everyones experience enjoyable.

If you are a first time visitor, then by all means, stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe. But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon, no traffic and great value - then consider a stay at the Suncoast. We (my husband, myself and two children) have stayed there 4 times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit. You can't beat the low room rates, and the rooms are HUGE and very nice. The hotel has a large casino, friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants, midrange restaurants, even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook. The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded. There is a movie theater and bowling alley. They also have a nightclub and on several occasions, my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price. They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both shows.The only downside is the distance from the Strip - which is probably a 30 minute cab ride.

We ate here a couple of times and the food is outstanding. The happy hour features a good selection of 3 local tap beers and the place is never really crowded. I'm not sure the tourists know they can come in otherwise I could imagine thirsty and hungry tourists at Seattle Center walking the minute or two to here, having a beer and a bite, and easily going right back to the Space Needle.

Our room was beautiful and although facing the front of the property, we had a beautiful view of the mountains. The flower boxes were so beautiful hanging on the small patio opening of our room. Hummingbirds flew on the window boxes taking nectar from the petals. It was very wonderful to see. The rooms are large and all accommodations were much like a 5+ hotel. Beautifully decorated we were very pleased with our rooms. We especially enjoyed the valet parking and Eric who was so helpful. The check in process was easy and accommodated our early check-in wishes. The European style breakfast was enjoyable with plenty of food to fill you up for a early day of shopping sight seeing and photo opportunity.

We found it quiet at night, even though we were there over a weekend, and there were families with young children staying at the hotel. The hotel staff was very friendly, and helpful. We found our room to be large, and clean. Bathroom was large and had double vanity. It is not the most fancy of rooms, but it had everything we needed. A fridge, coffee maker, flat screen TV. We ate at a couple of the restaurants in the hotel and they were good, the buffet breakfast was very good variety for the money. We saw a show at the showroom, every seat is a good one.

Walked in and like wow, is someone in here! Obviously they were long gone but not a good feeling. Called the front desk and they put me in another room. My new room seemed clean, though motel in general is a little run down. Motel itself is actually 3 separate buildings and I was in the south one. Area is fine and I felt safe walking around outside at night. Couple of real good honky tonks right next door (recommend Nashville Palace), though down side if you want peace and quiet you won't get it until they close up at around 2am. The outside pool is across the parking lot right up beside a Bar and Grill (Scoreboard - another fine honky tonk), though not like I was going to partake in outside pool in January anyway though is strange where the pool is located. By far the best about this motel is the location. Everything you need is within walking distance. All in all it was okay though not sure I would take family to stay there, though good for just me and would stay there again.

It wasn't the most comfortable, but it was great to have a separate bedroom area full kitchen.

From the parking lot, it's a straight shot through the front doors of the main entrance. I saw some people arrive by bus, which dropped them off on a side street. They were dragging their luggage up about 30 stairs to get to the parking lot! Instead, they could've just walked around along the street in front of the hotel to get to the lot.

I noticed that I was not the only one, another hotel guest was complaining about it at the front counter while I was there. My hotel charges were paid in advance as a birthday gift from a family member, so I thought I was all taken care of, and then found out that I had to give them my credit card just in case there were any charges in addition.

If you want to escape the incessant pounding music and Kardashian wannabes of the SOuth Beach hotels and neighboring Eden Roc of Fountainbleau then this is a great option. But also don't expect the service of any of these adjacent properties. THe service here is minimal at best. You wait forever at breakfast if you order off the menu. The doormen are non existent as is a concierge. THere is no room service and the food is mediocre. Terrible service out by the pool with a limited menu. No beach chairs - you have to pay an outside vendor. The bathroom was so tiny we could open the door less than halfway because it hit the toilet. Two people trying to use it was like a circus maneuver. It can't possibly be code. There are plastic cups for drinking - no glass but the bed was comfy and the flat screen TV was great. THe staff is not that helpful and the balcony's seem old and in need of paint. We had a gorgeous view but the balconies are interconnected with a rail between them. Our neighbor chain smoked on his balcony which made sitting out extremely unpleasant.

The lobby and bar are clean and modern. There is a pool table and lots of games to entertain kids and the young at heart in the lobby area.Downtown Philly is heavily populated with the homeless. The Methodist Church across Arch St from the Aloft Downtown seems like a focal point for them. Several times I was approached for a handout, but never felt like my wife, son and I were in any danger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend walking alone after dark in the area, but it is a bustling area during the day. We walked back as a group to the hotel from City Hall subway station after a Phillies game (maybe 11:30pm) and it was fine.It is very easy to get to a bus or subway train in a 5-10 minute walk. The views of City Hall are stunning and Love Park, the Reading Terminal Market, even Independence Hall and the Museum of Art are all walkable. The Convention Center is right next to the Aloft, so it would be a good place to stay if you were attending a conference there.There were always Uber and Lyft drivers a minute or 2 away when we needed to get anywhere. There are also cabs and the hotel offers Valet parking for 50 or so a night. There are also several parking ramps and some street parking in the area as well.There is a McDonalds across the street, but no restaurant in the building. There is a small store for food and drinks inside the lobby and a 7-11 convenience store a block away down the street on Broad St. Otherwise, I didn't find a ton of food options immediately around the hotel, but there are a lot of options a couple blocks away.It is certainly not cheap, but I liked the hotel and I would stay there again the next time I go back to Philadelphia.Hi JW, Thank you for the FIVE BUBBLE review!

Free Breakfast: continental breakfast with a variety of fruits, waffles, eggs, bagels, cereal, and coffee etcOverall : Had a very relaxing and fun two day stay here. I highly recommend it to anyone going down to the keys. I definitely plan to be back here on my next trip down. Dear Susana L,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Nice Stay and enjoyed our Breakfast and Pool. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Nice stay with us.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager",handicap,1,0,0,0,0,0,disputed

747,"Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with superior and thoughtful service and most importantly, we thank you for making us your new favorite hotel.Sincerely, Octavia Marginean",child handicap,1,0,1,0,0,0,disputed
9402,"We checked in at 6 pm, 3 hours after check in time of 3pm. Our room wasn't ready and housekeeping staff could be seen standing outside smoking. Granted I was given a 15 discount however, I would have happily paid another 50 per night to not be in that neighborhood. Employees smoking at the door to the lobby, the smell of weed in the hallway, a fight in the parking lot, literally people walking in off the street for the continental breakfast and asking us to use our cell phones, our room was 54 degrees upon entering.... I could go on and on, but won't. Needless to say I would never stay at this hotel or recommend it to anyone. Our friends chose this hotel because it was pet friendly. And they would hang out in our room because theirs reeked. Regardless of how much Lysol of ours they used, it smelled. On a scale of 1-10 it was a 1.",pet,0,1,0,0,0,0,disputed

1807,"First off I'll start with The Saint is an unique boutique hotel that sits on Eaton Street with access to Duval Street. We had booked what they call the petite double I believe and they aren't wrong. My husband paced it out and we figured it was approx 150 square feet. That being said it did have everything you needed and was tastefully done, but you'd never want to stay in it more then a night or two. They had a lovely balcony over looking Duval Street that sadly for us was 1 room away from ours and on NY's Eve they had their party on it . I wish I would have known this in advance as laying in bed after midnight it felt and sounded as if I was still in the middle of the dance floor. That aside I suppose I should have expected that being NY's but I've never been in a hotel especially a Marriott where the party was more important to the guest comfort. They have a lovely bar in the lobby away from the guest rooms which would have been a better and less noisy option for the quests who weren't attending their NYs party. All and all I'd say there are plenty of other choices to stay at in Key West at comparable costs (this wasn't cheap at 448.00 per night for 2 for the smallest room) that would cater more to the comfort of their guests then the 50 dollars a person they made at the NY's party.I apologize for the noise on New Year's Eve. Key West is a hot spot for the holiday and our hotel is known for the balcony countdown party overlooking Duval Street. The rates are comparable to other hotels for that night yet may have not been quieter on this busy day on the island. We hope you will give us another visit on a non-holiday and reserve one of our larger Superior King rooms that will be more comfortable for you. Happy New Year to you and your family.",child,0,0,1,0,0,0,disputed

Based on the information I decided to book the night. The hotel lobby's door was broken. The front staff upon checking in were not personable. They provided us the room and upon entering that part of the hotel, it was not too clean and this had me worried. I had read about a newly renovated part of the hotel and prayed we would have it. No such luck. The room smelled, there was a dirty toothbrush in the corner of the room. There was also a burn mark on the carpet from an iron.

The room and the annex in general is one of the worst places I've ever stayed.

But when we got there, no room available for city view. We were settled for a night in 3rd floor and we were assured the next 5nights we will be in the 6th floor. But the following day, they gave us a floor higher only, 4th floor. We cant see much of the city from 4th floor. All we can see is adjacent buildings. We were frustrated that there is no cafeteria for breakfast. Yeah, breakfast is included on the price but no chair to sit on, no table use. It is a grab and go breakfast. Very incovenient because breakfast is served in 5th and 6th floors's console table only. No microwave, no toaster. How can you eat the bagels they served in very cold temperature Secondly, we were not given instructions / info on our check in at the hotel what are the facilities they have for us. We only discovered while we were staying at the hotel. Like business center, fitness center,etc. The housekeeping, bad service! They forgot to replace the complimentary k-cup coffee. One day, they left a used pair of socks in our room. A pair of black socks rolled,dirty for a man whose size could be for a 6 footer and taller. My boys are only 5'3. Next day, they left again a wet soiled pink shirt on the table where the TV is. Why is that Everyday I always left as tip and a way of thank you for cleaning the room but all they leave is mess.

1536,"This is a lovely hotel where one is made to feel very welcome. An extra bonus (for cat lovers, at least) is Claire, the resident cat. The hotel is ideally located for exploring the utterly charming French Quarter. Our room was beautiful and very comfortable but as this is an old building, it is not very soundproof and other guests talking in the courtyard and entryway and wheeling their luggage around disturbed us early each morning - at 4am during the first night. The Frette linens and Molton Brown toiletries were much appreciated luxury touches. We were however disappointed by the breakfast - we ordered toast in preference to biscuits and one slice of toast each seemed rather meagre. Be warned - the coffee is flavoured with chicory - a New Orleans tradition but not to our taste. I would recommend this as a place to stay if you are happy to put up with the quirks of an old building but suggest eating breakfast elsewhere.We usually do have pure coffee in the freezer. We don't get many requests but we try to stay prepared. You simply needed to request it. I doubt that anyone could find breakfast spots in New Orleans that serve pure coffee. New Orleans traditional caf au lait is French roasted chicory coffee served with an equal part of warm milk. That is what we serve. That is what Caf du Monde serves. We are famous for our buttermilk biscuits but we do keep gluten free and whole grain bread for the guests who don't eat white flour. I do apologize that you were served only two slices of toast. An order of biscuits if four therefore an order of toast should also be at least four.Please if your travels bring you back to New Orleans give us another try. In addition to the tea , hot chocolate and iced coffee that are always available we will brew pure for you each morning. We will also give you a room on the second or third floor or even on the other side of the street so if we have late arrivals or early departures you won't be disturbed.Claire would be disappointed if you went elsewhere and so would I",pet,0,1,0,0,0,0,disputed

They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room.
